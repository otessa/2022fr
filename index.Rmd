All OTESSA Participants can attend the [Congress “Big Thinking” lecture series](https://www.federationhss.ca/en/congress/congress-2022/open-programming). These take place each day of the conference. Congress has “[open events](https://www.federationhss.ca/en/congress/congress-2022/calendar-open-events)” available as well (open to registrants across association conferences at Congress as well as those who hold community passes).

All OTESSA Registrants can also attend conference sessions offered by the [Canadian Association for the Study of Education (CSSE)](https://csse-scee.ca/), [Canadian Association for the Study of Higher Education (CSSHE)](https://csshe-scees.ca/), [Canadian Association of Learned Journals (CALJ)](https://www.calj-acrs.ca/), and [Canadian Association for the Study of Adult Education (CASAE)](https://www.casae-aceea.ca/) as we have reciprocity agreements in place. 

Please note that presenters must register in each conference in which they are presenting.
