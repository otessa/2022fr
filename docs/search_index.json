Sherri Spelic Hide and Seek: On Kids, Power, and Resistance in Education Je veux explorer ce qui se passe lorsque les apprentis qui nous sont confiés résistent à notre offre d’aide, notre expertise et notre enseignement. Comment comprendre que les élèves appliquent des compétences de refus en classe? Plutôt que de fournir des réponses, je m’appuierai sur les déclarations des élèves concernant la possibilité et la signification de dire “non” à l’école et je les utiliserai pour sonder notre compréhension et notre appréciation du pouvoir dans les mains et les voix des élèves. Nous poserons également la question suivante : dans quelle mesure nos pédagogies laissent-elles un espace pour la négociation et le partage du pouvoir ? Et où cela se manifeste-t-il dans la pratique? Maha Bali Outside-In: Openness as Subversion Nous parlons souvent de la façon dont l’éducation ouverte élargit l’accès, soutient le partage des connaissances et améliore potentiellement la qualité de l’éducation. Nous critiquons également l’éducation ouverte pour avoir parfois reproduit des inégalités malgré sa promesse de promouvoir la justice sociale. Mais qu’en est-il de la manière dont l’“ouverture” élimine/détruit les barrières en nous ? De quelle manière l’ouverture nous donne-t-elle du pouvoir de l’extérieur vers l’intérieur? Quand l’ouverture influence-t-elle le changement critique et quand peut-elle échouer à le faire? Au cours de cette session interactive, nous explorerons certaines des choses que l’ouverture rend possibles et qui ne sont souvent pas possibles entre les murs des institutions, et qui peuvent finir par remettre en question et subvertir l’injustice. Brenna Clarke Gray Things Unsaid: Exploring the Margins and Limits of Open Keywords: limits of open, challenges to open, autoethnography, pregnancy loss and miscarriage, institutional silences L’ouverture n’est pas un bien sans ambiguïté, une panacée, ou accessible à tous. Mais peut-être qu’elle pourrait être plus que toutes ces choses si, en tant que communauté, nous pouvions parler plus ouvertement des frontières et des limites de l’ouverture. Qu’est-ce que cela signifie de dire que nous sommes une communauté d’éducateurs ouverts? Quelle est la limite de l’ouverture, et comment rendre compte de sa définition? Quelles vérités - et celles de qui - restent inexprimées ou non dites, même dans les communautés qui se définissent comme ouvertes? Et qui peut choisir l’ouverture en toute sécurité? En proposant une auto-ethnographie sur la perte d’une grossesse dans le contexte de la pandémie universitaire comme point de départ de cette exploration, cette présentation cherche à définir les marges et les limites de l’ouverture et à s’interroger sur les avantages d’élargir la portée et les possibilités de l’ouverture dans nos institutions. Elle nous invite tous à imaginer une ouverture plus parfaite, ou du moins à réfléchir à la manière dont nous pouvons être plus nombreux à être soutenus pour dire nos non-dits.

Session Link Séance en parallèle 1.2 Four Pillars to (re)Think Universities (Quatre pilliers pour (re)penser les universités) Ann-Louise Davidson Mots-clés: IA, transformation des universités, micro-crédits, reconnaissance des acquis, mentorat, partenariats Résumé En mars 2020, la fermeture des universités en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19 a exacerbé de nombreux défis. Outre la perte dévastatrice de revenus due à l’absence d’étudiants sur le campus, les critiques concernant les évaluations traditionnelles, la pertinence du contenu, l’équité, la diversité et l’inclusion, l’écart de compétences entre ce que les diplômés offrent et ce que les employeurs recherchent apportent de nouvelles couches à la crise. Ces problèmes doivent être surmontés afin qu’une population diversifiée d’étudiants puisse être mieux préparée à un marché du travail de plus en plus exigeant et complexe, causé par des perturbations technologiques majeures alors que le monde entre dans l’ère de l’IA et de la 4e révolution industrielle. Plus que jamais, les universités doivent repenser le concept d’expériences et d’espaces d’apprentissage et offrir des possibilités d’apprentissage tout au long de la vie afin que des échanges intellectuels puissent avoir lieu à la fois entre les étudiants en tant que pairs et entre les étudiants et les acteurs extra-académiques pour apporter une plus grande pertinence à ce que les étudiants apprennent par le biais du programme d’études. Dans cette présentation, j’aborderai le concept d’une université alternative qui repose sur quatre piliers : les micro-crédits, la reconnaissance des acquis, le mentorat et les partenariats. Pause (1:45 – 2:15) Séances en parallèle 2 (2:15 – 3:45) Séance en parallèle 2.1 - WILDCARD: Indigenous Language Revival &amp; K12 Truth &amp; Reconciliation 2:15-2:45 Elders’ Conversations: Perspectives on leveraging digital technology in language revival (Research-Oriented) Melissa Bishop Keywords: language revival, Indigenous, elder, digital technology, computer-assisted language learning, guarded optimism, FNMI Abstract Elders are held in high regard in First Nations, Metis, and Inuit (FNMI) communities. They are the intergenerational transmitters of ancestral language and Indigenous knowledge. Without language revival initiatives, ancestral languages in FNMI communities are at risk of extinction. Leveraging digital technologies while collaborating with Elders can support revival initiatives. Through semi-structured interviews and qualitative analysis, this study addresses how three Elders who use technology in their ancestral language teaching (1) describe the benefits, drawbacks, and preferences of technology; (2) reveal the accuracy with which cultural knowledge is imparted through technology; and (3) view the impact of technology on their role as traditional knowledge keepers and intergenerational language transmitters? Findings suggest that while Elders acknowledge the benefits when leveraging digital tools in language revival initiatives, they have concerns about technology’s potential negative impacts on relationality [culture, spirituality, and medicine practices], a concept I have termed guarded optimism. Session Link 2:45-3:45 Truth and Reconciliation Through Inquiry-based Collaborative Learning (Practice-Oriented) Deirdre Houghton (Nechako Lakes School District &amp; University of Victoria), Gary Soles (Nechako Lakes School District &amp; University of Victoria), Andrew Vogelsang (Nechako Lakes School District &amp; University of Victoria), Valerie Irvine (University of Victoria), Frances “Guy” Prince (Knowledge Holder, Nak’azdli Whut’en), Leona Prince (Nechako Lakes School District), Carla Martin (Nechako Lakes School District), Jean-Paul Restoule (University of Victoria), Michael Paskevicius (University of Victoria) Keywords: Truth and Reconciliation, Inquiry, Secondary school, K-12, Cross-curricular, Project-based learning, Collaboration, Co-Teaching Abstract In this session, we will share a project conducted at [school name removed for review] in the [district name removed for review], which is in Northern British Columbia, Canada. Three highschool teachers from different disciplines (Social Studies, Digital Media, and Carpentry) launched a cross-curricular inquiry-based project, focusing on truth and reconciliation, that connected the learners in their highschool and the broader community, including knowledge holders from the local Indigenous communities. Those engaged in the project examined questions around what truth and reconciliation meant to the learners and its significance. Resulting products included a legacy wall containing individual learning represented in motifs, design of the feather using wood from around the world, and a video documentary containing interviews from school and community stakeholders. We will screen clips of videos during our session, but invite participants to pre-screen the two videos (Documentary Parts 1 and 2), which can be accessed on our YouTube playlist, where a process video and a reflection video are also available. Session Link Séance en parallèle 2.2 – Sustaining Positive Change: PSE Ethics &amp; PSE Scholarship 2:15-2:45 Surveillance in the System: Data as Critical Change in Higher Education (Research-Oriented) Bonnie Stewart (University of Windsor), Samatha Szcyrek (University of Windsor) Keywords: data, datafication, data literacy, data ethics, higher education Abstract Over recent decades, higher education infrastructures have become increasingly digitized and datafied. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of online learning platforms, trading the walls of the classroom for digital systems. Yet the surveillance, privacy, and security issues that such systems raise are minimally understood by those who teach and learn within them. This presentation overviews a 2020 pilot survey and 2021-22 qualitative study of higher education instructors from different parts of the globe. These projects explored the ways in which instructors from various locales and academic status positions understand data and classroom tools; the presentation draws on those studies to frame concerns about datafication amplifying inequity in higher education. Its premises are twofold: first, if higher education instructors, as knowledge workers, are not knowledgeable about the contexts within which they teach and conduct scholarship, then the construct of shared governance within higher education is inevitably undermined. Secondly, if faculty and academic decision-makers are not intentional about equitable and ethical use of digital platforms within higher education, students’ privacy and data is at risk. The presentation will outline findings and frame datafication as a critical change within higher education culture that could be addressed through a sector-wide ethics approach. Session Link Séance en parallèle 2.3 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: E-Texts / OER 2:15-2:45 Investigating the effects of computer-generated contextual landmarks on short-term recall of e-texts (Research-Oriented) Jon Dron, Rory McGreal, Vive Kumar, Jennifer Davies (Athabasca University) Keywords: e-text, recall, learning, navigation, OER, reading, open educational resources Abstract E-texts have many advantages over their paper counterparts, especially when reflowable and available as open educational resources (OERs). Unfortunately, research suggests that e-texts are, on the whole, less memorable than p-texts, in part due to their relative lack of visual navigational landmarks that help to anchor recall. The Landmarks project team is, therefore, building an application that inserts computer-generated artificial imperfections – abstract or representational landmarks - into the display of e-texts, that remain consistently associated with text passages even when documents are reflowed or reformatted. We hypothesize that it may consequently be easier to recall the associated contents. The application is designed to provide the means to present modified open texts using a range of generated landmarks and variations on them, and to test recall of the content. In this initial pilot study, results of tests for readers receiving different landmarks will be compared, with the intent of identifying promising approaches to use for future studies. Session Link 2:45-3:45 Community-Led Infrastructures for Open Access Books: A Sustainable Model and Platform (Practice-Oriented) Judith Fathallah (Lancaster University), Martin Eve (University of London, Tom Grady (University of London) Keywords: open access, open access books, open access monographs, open access publishing, open access infrastructures Abstract This talk introduces the work of the COPIM project (Community-Led Infrastructures for Open Access Books), then elaborates on our project of establishing the Open Book Collective and platform. The OBC, a charitable entity, will host an infrastructure and revenue management platform for the support, access, distribution and promotion of OA Books beyond inequitable book processing models. We then discuss a revenue model for publishers who wish to flip to an OA model without charging BPCs. This ‘Opening the Future’ model has already been successfully implemented by two publishers, the CEU Press and Liverpool University Press. We submit this proposal under the theme of sustaining positive change. The international move towards OA book publishing, in alignment with principles of cOAlition S, must be approached through models that render OA books equitable and accessible to the widest variety of international readers and authors. This necessitates thinking beyond BPC and the potential monopolisation of the OA landscape by major publishers, supporting a diversity of approaches in a networked model we call ‘scaling small’. Session Link Séance en parallèle 2.4 Flexible approaches to learning: Bridging inclusive/exclusive spaces through open educational practice (Practice-Oriented) Michelle Harrison (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: open educational practice, flexibility Abstract Throughout the pandemic, many educators have endeavoured to provide flexible educational approaches in response to the constantly shifting need for safe spaces and places for learning. For many the experiences during the pandemic, including a shift to remote learning and constant uncertainty, have highlighted ongoing digital inequities, and introduced new ones. With a focus on student agency and knowledge co-creation, many educators have looked to open educational practice (OEP), which often uses networked and digital technologies, as one way to create more inclusive and just learning experiences. But what does “engaging with openness” look like in practice? How do we take a critical approach to designing spaces that might help us meet the potential of OEP, considering that openness can also introduce other aspects of closure? In this presentation and conversation, I will use a spatial lens to mediate a discussion on open approaches to education that can provide more permeable access and flexibility for learners, but also critically examine how these approaches introduce tensions though overabundance, surveillance, and incursions on privacy. Session Link Warp and Weft: Weaving and Open Dissertation (Practice-Oriented) Helen Dewaard (Lakehead University &amp; University of British Columbia), Leo Havemann (University College London), Verena Roberts (University of Calgary &amp; Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: knowledge building, open thesis, stories, open scholarship, doctorate Abstract This session is an exploration of stories and lived experiences with opening the PhD and EdD process, presentations, and productions. Through the metaphor of weaving on a loom, the stories from practitioners and advocates of opening the dissertation are woven together through tension and movement. The values and risks of opening the dissertation incrementally change the fabric of the resulting tapestry. The nuanced questions and decisions shuttle between the macro, meso, micro, and nano levels. Decisional points are made by candidates in terms of where, when and with whom to build relationships, join into professional partnerships, enhance communications with media production tools, and draw on the support of others to innovate and collaborate in order to build knowledge. This presentation examines the granularities within the warp and weft of weaving an open dissertation. Session Link Incorporating Open Educational Pedagogies and Co-mentorship Practices in Graduate Education (Research-Oriented) Cindy Ives, Beth Perry, Pamela Walsh (Athabasca University) Keywords: open educational pedagogy, collaborative autoethnography, graduate students, co-mentorship Abstract Our collaborative autoethnographic study (CAE) explores our use of principles of open educational pedagogy (OEP) and co-mentorship to enhance graduate teaching and learning. Working within an open, online university, we are investigating the nature and extent to which we use OEP and co-mentorship, and exploring the outcomes for ourselves and our students. We seek to reduce hierarchical relationships, prioritizing student-centred practices. We aim to improve ourselves as open, flexible distance educators and to support successful student learning and research. Consistent with CAE, we are collecting self-reflective and dialogic data, and artefacts from our co-mentorship and open educational practices. As participants in this study, we are experiencing the power of CAE as a research method that moves us beyond traditional discourse leading to personal and professional growth. We anticipate that our research findings will help position our graduates and ourselves as creative thinkers, learners, and contributors in the 21st century during these times of critical change. Session Link Critical reflection: How can open reflexive frameworks redefine academic practices? (Practice-Oriented) Helen DeWaard (Lakehead University &amp; University of British Columbia), Shauna Burnie (Lakehead University) Keywords: reflective practice, open educational practices, academia, duoethnography, blogging Abstract The practice of critical reflection should be infused into higher education academic programs in order to sustain positive change in masters and doctoral programs. Through this duoethnographic (Norris &amp; Sawyer, 2012) examination of personal experiences in opening up academia, the presenters will share insights, issues, and practices for infusing reflexive practice through the use of blogging. The presenters will share open reflective practices as evidenced throughout the processes, productions, and presentations of their masters and PhD scholarship. The presenters will showcase two different reflective frameworks academics can employ in order to structure their own self-reflective practices, including the 21st Century Educator framework from Bates (2014) and the ORID reflective model from the Institute for Cultural Affairs (2014). In light of the rapid and disruptive shifts to online platforms resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, critical reflexive practices in open digital spaces can redefine what it means to be a reflective and connective academic. Session Link Séance en parallèle 2.5 2:15-2:45 – Sustaining Positive Change – PSE Open Open educational practice and research resources created by students, for students (Practice-Oriented) Marie Bartlett &amp; Students (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: Undergraduate Research, Students, Open Pedagogical Practice, WordPress, Research Resources Abstract CURN (Canadian Undergraduate Research Network) is an emerging community supported by the offices of Research and Graduate Studies and Open Learning at Thompson Rivers University (TRU), which is located in Secwepemcúl̓ecw on the unceded land of the Secwépemc peoples, on the interior plateau of British Columbia. For a number of years, groups of TRU students have been building a CURN website as part of their undergraduate research ambassador roles, adding to each other’s work every semester: curn.trubox.ca/. Since the start of the initiative, the objective has been to create an open resource that would get students interested and engaged in undergraduate research. Designed as an open pedagogy project, student research ambassadors were given the autonomy to choose the format and the structure of the resource, decide which topics to include, what they wanted to learn from the project, and how to organize their groups and creative efforts. Session Link 2:45-3:45: – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – PSE Online Building digital fluency skills during the rapid transition to online and hybrid teaching through open access with the Ontario Extend program (Practice-Oriented) Alissa Bigelow (eCampusOntario) Keywords: online, transitions, teaching and learning, Ontario Extend Abstract At a time of unprecedented change within the educational system due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Ontario Extend professional learning program provides a platform for community, collaboration, and digital fluency skill development amongst postsecondary educators across the province of Ontario. A key driver for the Ontario Extend program is to provide educators with the ability to leverage diverse educational technology tools to create a more accessible learning environment for students in online and hybrid learning environments. The program framework builds upon “The 21st Century Educator” model (Bates, 2016), which encompasses the knowledge, skills, and attitudes identified as the foundational skills required to “thrive (and not just survive) in a digital world” (Coldwell-Nelson, 2018; Martin &amp; Grudziecki, 2006). Educators are encouraged to engage with six online modules and reflect upon specific elements of their teaching practice. Each of the six modules promotes a learning journey focused on a combination of foundational upskilling and reskilling, with digital badges awarded upon the completion of each module. Once an educator has completed all six modules, they are awarded the Empowered Educator micro-credential and join the growing community of Extend educators. This session will provide an overview of the program and scaling efforts to date, with time for questions.

Improving overall sustainability can occur by focusing on public schools as energy generation sites and opportunities to model sustainable communities for the world.The purpose of this session is to model potential environmental and financial gains that may be expected to contribute to improved sustainability that come from using rooftops and other potentially unused public school community land. When coupled with the use of sustainable building practices such as aquaculture and permaculture, we demonstrate how this approach could generate needed energy to make them more sustainable while also helping fund the facilities to make the communities they serve more sustainable as well. Such approaches may help reduce the negative impacts resulting from rising, environmental change-fueled school expenses that require finding new sources of revenue and savings. Session Link Séance en parallèle 3.2 – Sustaining Positive Change – PSE Open Sustaining Complexity: Why Higher Education Should Avoid TechnoSolutionism (Practice-Oriented) Jim Luke (Lansing Community College), Bonnie Stewart (University of Windsor) Keywords: change, technology, complexity, technosolutionism, cynefin Abstract During the pandemic, two long-separate perspectives on digital technologies and the work of higher education have become even more distinct. This presentation will frame these distinctions in terms of ‘complicated’ and ‘complex’ domains, using Snowden &amp; Boone’s (2007) Cynefin framework. The session will demonstrate how management perspectives on higher education reflect complicated approaches to problems in Cynefin terms. We will show how, in relation to educational technology and online learning, complicated approaches obscure the complexity of learning for claims of simple, technical answers, or what Morozov (2013) calls ‘technosolutionism.’ We will suggest, on the other hand, that critical pedagogies and open educational practices align with what Cynefin calls the complex domain. Complex problems - like the human problems of pedagogy and learning - cannot be solved with the complicated approaches that technosolutionism lends itself to. Post-pandemic, with the huge incursion technological platforms - and promises - have made into higher education, choosing complicated approaches to pedagogical problems risks failing to address the core mission of teaching and learning entirely. Thus, we explore how to distinguish between complicated and complex problems, and suggest practices and pathways to allow higher education professionals to build on the pandemic’s changes in positive ways. Session Link Séance en parallèle 3.3 – Addressing the New Inequities: Critical EdTech Rejecting the ready-made future: Reimagining technologies from and for the classroom (Research-Oriented) Esteban Morales, Rachel Horst (University of British Columbia) Keywords: imagination, technology, case study Abstract Discussions about technology are often rooted in a combination of technological determinism, libertarianism, and free-market economics. This growing trend prioritizes a vision of an optimistic future driven by never-ending innovation. Nevertheless, this ideology is criticized as it frequently favours some future visions over others—those of entrepreneurs and investors over those of everybody else. Missing perspectives include teachers and students, whose technological environments are increasingly privatized and commercialized. Accordingly, this presentation explores the possibilities of reimagining the future of technology with students and teachers. To achieve this, we present two case studies. The first case study explores the imagined future of social media and violence with Colombian undergraduate students, highlighting the possibilities to reach transformative learning through imagination. The second case study explores a futures literacies workshop in which teacher candidates critique the technological futures embedded within a selection of cultural and artistic texts. Overall, this presentation emphasizes the importance of opening discussions of the future of technology to those involved in educational settings. Session Link Séance en parallèle 3.4 – Addressing the New Inequities: Open Open Educational Practices (OEP): Critical Policy Analysis in the Canadian Post-Secondary Education Context (Research-Oriented) Mara Bordignon (University of Western Ontario) Keywords: open educational practices, post-secondary education, critical research, policy analysis Abstract Open educational practices (OEP) represent exciting possibilities for social justice solutions to traditionally oppressive neoliberal publishing systems and colonial practices. OEP is multidimensional encapsulating both content, being open - data, educational resources, science, source code, and systems, and processes such as open - access, scholarship, learning, teaching, and pedagogy. OEP represents a shift towards equitable models in rights, governance, infrastructure, and funding, but is controversial in attempting to dismantle corporatized power structures. Critical OEP research shows that open solutions may not address some of the structural inequities, paradoxically perpetuating market-based approaches. Progress in OEP creation, adoption, and use in Canadian post-secondary education (PSE) has occurred at a rapid rate. This paper will provide a problem overview, with relevance to the Canadian OEP field and policy landscape. The lack of policy is troubling so it will be argued that understandings of OEP have not been critically analyzed in national, provincial, and institutional policy. Looking at global discourse documents guiding policy development should also be scrutinized. Post-structuralism is critical framework that enables questioning of the validity of existing political and corporate power structures, along with critical approaches to policy analysis that can interrogate the situatedness of OEP in current prevailing political ideologies. Session Link Séance en parallèle 3.5 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – Online &amp; Society Online or Remote Learning and Mental Health (Research-Oriented) Stephanie Moore (University of New Mexico), Michael Barbour (Touro University California), George Veletsianos (Royal Roads University) Keywords: online learning, remote learning, mental health Abstract While there has been a great deal of debate over the impact of online and remote learning on mental health and well-being, there has been no systematic syntheses or reviews of the research on this particular issue. In this session, we will present a review of research on mental health / well-being and online or remote learning. Our preliminary analyses suggest that little scholarship existed prior to 2020 and that most of these studies have been conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report three findings: (a) it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to control for pandemic effects in the data, (b) studies present a very mixed picture, with variability around how mental health and well-being are measured and how / whether any causal inferences are made in relation to online and remote learning, and (c) results across these studies are extremely mixed. Based on this study, we suggest that researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and administrators exercise extreme caution around making generalizable assertions with respect to the impacts of online/remote learning and mental health. Session Link Pause (5:30 - 6:00) Séances en parallèle 4 - Conférenciers invités (6:00 - 6:45) Séance en parallèle 4.1 The Liberated Learner: How to Learn with Style Terry Greene (Trent University), Giulia Forsythe (Brock University) Keywords: education, post-secondary, online learning, study skills, collaboration, learning technology, open education, OER Abstract The Liberated Learner, funded by the eCampusOntario Virtual Learning Strategy, is an inter-institutional collaboration that brings together student co-designers and elearning professionals. This open resource consists of four modules that mirror the Ontario Extend for Educators modules (Lopes &amp; Porter, 2018), but are customised to the learner context. These modules are Learner (learning strategies), Technologist (digital fluency skills), Collaborator (communication, group work, community member), &amp; Navigator (curating, fact checking, other scholarly skills). The goal is to provide learners a similar opportunity to gain confidence and independence in their post-secondary experience online. Recognizing that most issues post-secondary students face are complex and ill-structured (Cormier, 2021), the design and development of the Liberated Learner open modules were primarily student-led. During a week-long design sprint, 120 students generated 99 wicked problems. This collection of personal stories document students’ real life post-secondary challenges. These stories then informed the content of the 4 modules as they were developed together with student co-designers from each institution. They also provided a pathway into the Liberated Leaner modular support at multiple levels of experience (beginner, intermediate, advanced). Each module also consists of a student created Beats to Study to intro to help learners get into the learning groove. Session Link Séance en parallèle 4.2 “Critical Change in Online Education - What We Can Learn (And Not Learn) From COVID as a Context” Changement critique en formation en ligne - Ce que nous pouvons apprendre (et ne pas apprendre) du contexte de COVID Matt Bower Abstract La pandémie de COVID-19 a entraîné une transformation rapide de l’éducation dans le monde entier, catapultant la technologie aux yeux de certains de son rôle de méchant de l’éducation à celui de héros. Alors que l’éducation internationale revient à un certain degré de normalité, que pouvons-nous vraiment apprendre de l’expérience COVID-19 ? Cette présentation utilise la théorie de l’apprentissage médiatisé par la technologie et le cadre de l’évaluation globale et de l’utilisation de la technologie dans l’éducation pour identifier ce que nous pouvons et ne pouvons pas apprendre, en partant du principe que la pandémie COVID-19 a été, et ne pourra jamais être, qu’un contexte éducatif. L’identification des attributs du contexte de la COVID-19 et de la manière dont ces attributs ont façonné l’éducation peut alors fournir des idées qui peuvent à leur tour être transférées à d’autres périodes, lieux et personnes. Le rôle accru des parents dans l’éducation des enfants est pris comme exemple, avec des données révélant comment la conception de l’apprentissage en ligne devrait être modifiée pour tenir compte des connaissances, des responsabilités, des perspectives et des préférences des parents. Les implications pour la conception et l’étude de l’apprentissage en ligne sont discutées. Session Link Réseautage et discussions (6:45 – 7:00) …ou jusqu’à la fin de vos conversations!

Comment comprendre que les élèves appliquent des compétences de refus en classe? Plutôt que de fournir des réponses, je m’appuierai sur les déclarations des élèves concernant la possibilité et la signification de dire “non” à l’école et je les utiliserai pour sonder notre compréhension et notre appréciation du pouvoir dans les mains et les voix des élèves. Nous poserons également la question suivante : dans quelle mesure nos pédagogies laissent-elles un espace pour la négociation et le partage du pouvoir ? Et où cela se manifeste-t-il dans la pratique?

Plus précisément, j’explore l’interdépendance des logiques de scolarisation en personne et en ligne en m’appuyant sur mes recherches dans les écoles secondaires de l’Ontario ainsi que sur mon expérience d’enseignement en ligne depuis plus de dix ans. Alors que nous tentons de jeter un pont entre la théorie et la pratique, comment pouvons-nous tenir compte de la variété des contextes dans lesquels l’éducation en ligne émerge, en tant que réponse au sous-financement de l’éducation publique, en tant qu’imaginaire collectif qui façonne la politique éducative. Qu’est-ce que cela signifie de réimaginer l’éducation en ligne tout en réimaginant les institutions et les politiques qui structurent la scolarité ? Au cours de mon intervention, j’encourage le public à réfléchir ensemble à l’éducation, à la communauté et à la démocratie, afin de remettre en question la neutralité des valeurs de la technologie, qui n’est pas séparée de notre contexte social et culturel mais en dépend. Session Link Séance en parallèle 5.2 “Shaping ‘the new normal’: Reflection and Design for Iterating Forward” (Façonner la “nouvelle normalité” : Réflexion et conception pour aller de l’avant) Stephanie Moore, University of New Mexico Keywords: reflective practice, design as agency Abstract Schön (1983) décrit la réflexion-en-action comme une sorte de conversation que les concepteurs engagent tout au long du processus de conception et avec la situation. Whitbeck (1996) définit l’éthique non pas comme une évaluation ou un jugement visant à déterminer le bien ou le mal, mais comme un processus de conception, d’élaboration de plans d’action possibles en réponse à des problèmes moraux. Dans cette session, ces deux principes - la réflexion et la conception - forment la base de l’élaboration de nos réponses aux besoins mis en lumière par la pandémie et la rhétorique autour de la “nouvelle normalité”. Cette session comprendra un temps de réflexion sur les visions souhaitables des “nouvelles normales” et une discussion sur les thèmes de nos visions. Nous explorerons ensuite ensemble l’idée de Whitbeck de “l’éthique en tant que conception” et la façon dont elle peut être utilisée pour mettre en œuvre une vision d’une nouvelle normalité à travers nos processus de conception et les produits ou environnements conçus que nous créons. Notre exploration du design comme moyen de mettre en œuvre une nouvelle normalité comprendra une “exposition d’inspiration de design” avec du temps pour faire le tour des idées et ensuite l’exploration de comment et où une vision d’une “nouvelle normalité” peut être intégrée à la fois dans la conception et la planification de l’enseignement et dans la conception des systèmes éducatifs.

Unfortunately, research highlights that practitioners make little use of their collaborative practices and insufficiently promote student agency during the IEP process. The MIXITÉ collaborative research project adopts a collaborative partnership approach in which adults collaborate and maximize their agency and that of the student in the Digital-ACTIVE process of their IP. A collaborative methodology taking place at a distance allowed students, their parents and teachers, the management and the psychoeducator of a school, a patient-partner, social workers and managers of a CIUSSS to co-create two strategies to be implemented. attempt to improve collaborative practices focused on student agency in their IP. This communication presents 1) the process of the IP Digital-ACTIVE to be tested and 2) the planning of intersectoral meetings in order to better understand the roles of each and create cohesion between the actors. Session Link 2:45-3:45 Global viewpoints on Open Educational Resources for Blended Learning (Research-Oriented) Connie Blomgren (Athabasca University) Keywords: open educational resources, OER, MOOCs, teacher perceptions, natural language analysis Abstract The purpose of this exploratory research is to examine the perspectives of educators who have participated in the Blended Learning Practice MOOC with regards to their understanding of Open Educational Resources (OER). OER form part of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal number 4 ( i.e. Education for all) and UNESCO has been supporting OER since 2002. Yet, the understanding and uptake of OER has not reached saturation at either higher education or K-12. This research project captured a global OER perspective by educators and examined the impressions of MOOC participants with regards to OER as part of blended learning and teaching. This study includes participants from many countries including the Global South, which positions this study uniquely. These areas of the world may deeply benefit from OER and openness in education yet are seldom represented within studies. Researchers used natural language process automation analysis through Amazon Web Services and Ronin. Matters and concerns  regarding cloud computing for educational research also informs this presentation using Lewin’s force field analysis of the potential change.   Session Link Séance en parallèle 6.2 2:15-2:45 - Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – PSE Favoriser l’alignement pédagogique lors d’une migration en formation à distance: Une Démarche SoTL (Practice-Oriented) Marie-Michelle Gouin, Constance Denis, Nathalie Lefebvre, Stéphanie Lanctôt, Marilou Belisle (Université de Sherbrooke) Keywords: Formation et usages du numérique, Apprentissage par projet, Démarche SoTL, Apprentissage expérientiel Abstract Pour résoudre des enjeux dénotés dans l’un des cours d’intégration d’un programme universitaire offert en formation continue (ex. absentéisme, démotivation, désengagement et faible taux de réussite) , une démarche Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) a été menée. Cette dernière comporte six phases soit : l’analyse, l’appropriation, la conception, l’implantation, l’évaluation et la diffusion. Étant donné la diversité et les besoins des cohortes estudiantines, une migration en formation à distance basée sur une approche inspirée de la pédagogie inversée a été initiée pour l’ensemble des cours du programme, en parallèle au présent projet. L’analyse spécifique au cours a mis en lumière l’alignement pédagogique comme étant à l’origine des enjeux susmentionnés. L’approche expérientielle et l’apprentissage par problème ont été retenus et le cours a été entièrement revu pour en maximiser l’alignement pédagogique. Le cours a été recentré autour de la planification d’une intervention en entreprise. L’implantation du nouveau projet d’apprentissage s’est faite en deux temps (2020 et 2021), mais la phase d’évaluation a été reportée au printemps 2022. Les résultats seront connus au moment de la présentation. Session Link 2:45-3:45 – Sustaining Positive Change – PSE Online Sustaining Positive Change in the Teaching Scholars’ Online Community of Practice (Research-Oriented) Andrew Mardjetko, Michele Jacobsen, Beth Archer-Kuhn, Cari Din, Lorelli Nowell, Heather Jamniczky (University of Calgary) Keywords: community of practice, online learning, educational leadership, SOTL Abstract We examine and reflect on sustaining positive change and innovation in Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL) research and practice through collective engagement in an Online Community of Practice (OCoP). Academic faculty, educational developers and educational leaders from adult education, educational technology, kinesiology, nursing, medicine, and social work are bound by shared commitments to educational leadership, SOTL, mentorship, and sustaining positive change in learner focused practices in higher education. Our interdisciplinary OCoP is supported and extended through institutionally sponsored research, expert support, and a robust technological infrastructure to amplify online educational leadership of teaching and learning within and across diverse disciplines. Members collaborate and learn online with colleagues who lead diverse change initiatives, connect and communicate using a range of online technologies, access shared expertise and curated resources, and collectively provide awareness within and beyond our OCoP. In this presentation, we share how and why members are engaged 1) in navigating changes in modality for individual SOTL projects, 2) as educational leaders and mentors in leading innovation with each other, and 3) in sustaining positive change across campus as educational leaders of learning and teaching in higher education. Session Link Séance en parallèle 6.3 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – PSE 2:15-2:45 Design Strategy Plus Pandemic Serendipity: Technology-Enhanced Entrepreneurship Education using Open Learning and Micro-credentials (Practice-Oriented) Sonja Johnston, Michele Jacobsen (University of Calgary) Keywords: open learning, entrepreneurship education, micro-credentials, work-integrated learning, pedagogy Abstract In a recent pilot for a redesign of an undergraduate entrepreneurship course, factors for consideration included: materials and resource costs, ability for work-integrated learning, and responding to the contemporary needs of the workplace outside of the postsecondary institution. The utilization of an industry leader’s open learning platform and the implementation of micro-credential certificates supported student experience to bridge theory to experience and work-integrated learning. The use of multiple credentials (in addition to course grading) provided additional dimensions of learning and experience. This redesign was developed through 2019 and launched just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in the winter semester of 2020. The intentional strategy of the course design was to build competency through theory and content, develop application with micro-credential certificates, and then to utilize work-integrated learning by creating an ecommerce website to service an existing business or start-up plan. Serendipitously, as businesses and the ecommerce platform were forced to quickly adjust in response to the impacts of the pandemic, students were able to learn and design in real circumstances and applications. Critical questions are being raised concerning equitable access to technology and the reciprocity of gains in the open learning platform between students, institutions, and profitable businesses. Session Link 2:45-3:45 Adaptive Learning Uptake in Ontario’s Post-secondary System: Factors Supporting Motivation, Implementation, and Readiness (Practice-Oriented) Don Eldridge, Megan Houghton (eCampusOntario) Keywords: Adaptive Learning, motivation, innovation, organizational readiness Abstract Adaptive learning (AL) leverages the power of technology to continuously modify instructional content based on the behaviours and needs of learners resulting in a personalized learning experience. Adoption of AL in higher education remains low despite evidence of efficacy. Looking specifically at the Ontario higher education context, the researchers used a mixed methods research approach to conduct an environmental scan examining the current uses of AL across the post-secondary sector and challenges to adopting AL and other innovations more broadly. The study used a framework based upon previous work by Mirata et al. (2020) and Scaccia et al. (2015) to examine motivation, organizational capacity, and innovation specific capacity of educators and institutions as antecedents for innovations such as adaptive learning. Findings suggest that while educators see AL as holding promise to support learner outcomes, they also see it as complex, resource intensive, and an undertaking that marks a significant departure from traditional teaching methods. Developing a provincial training and support system for AL might serve to improve motivation, refine prioritization, and bolster confidence for adaptive learning. The lessons learned and the recommendations made through this study will serve well others considering educational innovations in other contexts. Session Link Séance en parallèle 6.4 Teaching, learning, and assessment activities used in additional language courses in blended contexts in Quebec’s higher education (Research-Oriented) Paula Andrea Arancibia Erazo (Université de Sherbrooke) Keywords: blended learning, additional language teaching, second language, foreign language, activities, assessment, teaching and learning Abstract Knowing and additional language (AL) is an essential skill to master in the 21st century since it allows individuals to interact with people from different countries and cultures (Shih, 2010). In Canada and Quebec, due to the high immigration rates (Ministère de l’Immigration de la Francisation et de l’intégration, 2020) AL courses are necessary for immigrants to learn either English or French. Moreover, after the COVID-19 pandemic, delivery methods such as online and blended learning have become prevalent since they allow to assure the continuity of learning. Consequently, the aim of this study is to describe the teaching, learning and assessment activities used by instructors in blended courses to promote AL skills development in Quebec’s higher education. To do this, we adopt a qualitative methodology and the use of secondary data including semi-structured interviews and course documentation. Data analysis methods include a thematic and documentary analysis. The sample is constituted by 3 additional language instructors (N=3). Finally, the results will consist of effective activities that promote the development of AL skills in blended courses in higher education. They are expected to be of interest for practitioners in the field and to contribute to fill a gap in the literature. Session Link Students Feel More Dignified”: Alternative Grading and Self-Assessment in Online Courses (Research-Oriented) Sharon Lauricella (Ontario Tech University) Keywords: alternative grading, peer assessment, self assessment, ungrading Abstract Judging, marking, and ranking students is a common practice in higher education, though the pervasive dependence upon grades to dictate a student’s success or failure has come under increased scrutiny.  While “ungrading” and alternative grading practices are endorsed by progressive educators, there are few systematic, empirical studies of student responses to nontraditional grading.  This study analyzed student reports of the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements for “ungrading” using peer and self assessment in two fourth-year undergraduate courses (n=87).  Student responses were overwhelmingly positive; notable positive effects of ungrading include increased motivation, decreased stress, and improved connection with peers.  Challenges included being too self-critical and needing the guidance of a rubric for a gauge of where students stand in the course.  Implications of this study include suggestions for freedom from the restriction, stress, and competition associated with grades, and the potential to move toward a postsecondary experience characterized by authenticity and and intrinsic motivation. Session Link Student Motivation in Online Learning Based on Self Determination Theory: A Literature Review (Research-Oriented) Behnoosh Khoramrooz, Valerie Irvine, Joan Martin (University of Victoria) Behnoosh Khoramrooz, Valerie Irvine, Joan Martin, Mariel Miller (University of Victoria) Keywords: online learning, motivation, self-determination theory, online teaching, student attribution, e-learning, autonomy, competence, relatedness Abstract Prior to the COVID-19, online learning has been gradually increasing in education (Allen &amp; Seaman, 2010); the pandemic, however, interrupted that trajectory. Seemingly overnight, educational institutions were demanded to change in-person instruction to online (Rahman et al., 2021). One of the biggest problems in online learning has been a high rate of student dropout (Chen &amp; Jang, 2010), experiencing pandemic waves caused an even more decrease in student motivation (Thompson et al., 2021). Student motivation predicts their engagement and successful completion of a course (Ucar &amp; Kumtepe, 2021). Without supporting students’ motivation, decreasing dropout rate and enhancing persistence will not happen (Ng, 2019). Self-determination theory (SDT) is a powerful theory focused on enhancing motivation by satisfying three basic human needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017). In this session, we review online learning studies that use an SDT framework to address three questions: First, have all three components of SDT been researched equally? Second, how have these components been measured in different studies? Third, are there changes in research since the onset of the pandemic; in particular, is relatedness being addressed more frequently? Finally, we provide recommendations for future research and practices at both teaching and system levels. Session Link Assessment and Digital Technology in Higher Education: A Review of the Literature (Research-Oriented) Colin Madland (University of Victoria) Keywords: assessment, technology, higher education, approaches to assessment Abstract Assessment is a core component of teaching and learning in higher education and has been impacted in various ways by the growth of technology in society and education. Assessment is a process of inferring ability (knowledge or skills) based on evidence provided through the completion of various types of performance tasks. Technology has impacted assessment practices in higher education in multiple ways, including large scale admissions and certification exams, classroom assessment practices such as monitoring remote learners as they write exams, and also enabling instructors to more closely align their assessment practices with common outcomes of 21st century higher education including collaboration, problem solving, creativity, and divergent thinking. This review of the literature explores how technology has impacted assessment practices in higher education in light of the model of Pellegrino et al.’s assessment triangle and DeLuca et al.’s approaches to classroom assessment with the objective of synthesizing current literature to inform ethical assessment policy and practice in technologically mediated higher education. Session Link Séance en parallèle 6.5 - WildCard – PSE Open 2:15-2:45 Open Educational Resources as a Tool for Immersive EDI Professional Development (Research-Oriented) Sara Humphreys, Loren Gaudet (University of Victoria) Keywords: EDI, anti-racism, decolonization, academic writing, OER Abstract Currently approaches to professional development comprise workshops, teaching observations, videos, websites and other resources instructors access outside of class time. However, training in EDI and decolonialization requires immersion, sustained engagement, and connection to new pedagogical practices. This presentation offers an evidence-based case study outlining how we developed and connected instructors to Open Education Resources (OER) constructed based on local Coast Salish knowledges, anti-racism pedagogy, and wise practices in inclusivity. The case study in question involved the creation of Why Write, an anti-racist and decolonial writing textbook for first-year students at the University of Victoria. This OER was created by an interdisciplinary team of librarians, anti-racism and inclusivity researchers, writing centre leaders, and academic writing specialists all informed by Indigenization and decolonization experts. In this presentation, we argue that anti-racist and decolonial OER such as ours offers immersive EDI professional development in two key ways: through process and through content (Bali, Cronin, and Jhangiani 2020).[1] [1] Bali, M., Cronin, C., &amp; Jhangiani, R. S. (2020). Framing Open Educational Practices from a Social Justice Perspective. Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 2020(1), 10. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jime.565 Session Link Making in-roads toward multi-access learning and teaching (Practice-Oriented) Mariel Miller, Valerie Irvine, Hayley Hewson (University of Victoria) Keywords: Abstract In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the University of Victoria implemented two multi-access classrooms enabling face-to-face and online learners to attend and participate in classes concurrently. While multi-access learning can support more flexible, accessible, and equitable learning, it requires faculty to substantially reconsider and redesign their teaching. As such, a significant barrier to the adoption of high-quality multi-access learning is the time and effort required of faculty, particularly for those already fatigued by the massive pivots to emergency online teaching brought about by the pandemic. In this session, we will draw on our experiences as educators to describe three practical ways faculty can approach and gain confidence in multi-access learning: (a) multi-access as a contingency, (b) multi-access as a limited event, where multi-access learning is provided for certain or select classes rather than the full course; (c) team-teaching with an experienced multi-access instructor, and (d) multi-access courses designed in three layers with instructional hours divided into whole group, decentralized synchronous learning pods for peer discussion, and asynchronous engagement (e.g., with resource materials, annotation, blogging, and backchannel chat). For each, we will discuss benefits and limitations and key considerations for preserving the integrity of the learning experience.

Although challenges existed in the implementation of this student centered approach, some teachers addressed these obstacles through the use of technology, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and the Response to Intervention (RTI) frameworks. This paper combined two studies which included both teachers’ and students’ perspectives of inclusive classrooms. The primary study examined the instructional practices of eight elementary school teachers who experienced successful transitions to inclusion in bricks and mortar and virtual classrooms. The second study explored the experiences of students with and without disabilities who participated in virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through online interviews and classroom observations, the teachers demonstrated how technology could increase student engagement, differentiate instruction, and provide students with alternative instruction and assessment methods. However, inconsistencies were revealed in screening approaches to identify the needs of students and monitor students’ progress. The students engaged in multiple options of learning with some experiences more positive than others. The paper concludes with a summary of technology-based inclusive practices shared by teachers and students. Session Link Parity of Participation and the Digital Divide (Practice-Oriented) Tanya Elias, University of Calgary Keywords: learning design, low bandwidth technology, small-scale technology Abstract Fraser’s defines “parity of participation” as a holistic social arrangement that enables full participation, involving processes of redistribution, recognition and representation. These ideas stand in stark contrast to many of the current and historical patterns of disparity of participation within distance education that increasingly involve complex “learning solutions” that rely heavily on the use of video conferencing, streaming video and LMSs that limit participation in a variety of ways. This approach appears to be based on two underlying assumptions: first, students have consistent access to stable, high-bandwidth internet connection; and second, sharing student data and use in machine learning/ artificial intelligence is benign. Despite these assumptions, there is ample evidence that both internet access and the effects of data tracking are not evenly distributed. Northern, rural, Indigenous and poor communities consistently lack access to stable internet; data tracking and machine learning/ AI tend to cause the most harm to historically disadvantaged groups, particularly people of colour. This session considers how we got to a place where learning design is almost completely dependent on highly inequitable technological platforms and how older, small-scale and low bandwidth approaches to learning design might assist in resetting out trajectory towards parity of participation. Session Link Séance en parallèle 7.2 – Addressing New Inequities/Sustaining Positive Change: PSE Online &amp; Open From Study Abroad to Virtual Study Abroad: Decolonizing and Opening the Academy (Practice-Oriented) Kristine Dreaver-Charles (University of Saskatchewan), Michael Cottrell (University of Saskatchewan) Keywords: open textbooks, open education resources, OER, equitable access, catalysts of open Abstract This contribution is situated at the University of Saskatchewan, where Open Education Resources have been supported since 2014-2015. During the pandemic we began the work of translating The Lymphatic System of the Dog, by Dr. Hermann Baum into English. Originally published in 1918, Dr Baum’s book has been transitioned into Pressbooks, with the addition of ancillary resources. Balancing the legacy of Dr. Baum’s research with our own innovations in assessment and design engages new generations of learners and practitioners. The benefits for faculty and graduate students in designing and publishing openly must also be acknowledged. Locally designed and produced open education resources created with and by our university community is of significance to the academy. The use of open textbooks in university classes establishes a discourse and refinement of knowledge ensuring quality resources are designed and shared. Session Link Digital platforms and algorithmic erasure: What are the implications? (Practice-Oriented) Colin Madland (University of Victoria), Maxwell Ofosuhene (Trinity Western University), and Jennifer Adkins (Trinity Western University) Keywords: racial discrimination, algorithmic bias, software, technology, erasure Abstract People of colour have experienced challenges with appearing properly in pictures since the beginning of photography. Typically, they show up as being very underexposed, looking like they are in a shadow, especially when in the same frame as people with pale skin. This problem has persisted despite significant advances in camera film and, subsequently, in digital sensor technologies in modern cameras. Considering that most digital tools are built on a foundation of yesterday’s analog tools, this challenge has persisted in multiple forms in modern digital contexts. For example, on Twitter and on Zoom where we encountered this challenge in September 2020 during faculty meetings on Zoom. Our zoom erasure experience and subsequent Twitter crop experience raised questions for our investigation: why do people of colour experience erasure on zoom and other digital platforms? Is this problem new? What are the outcomes of our experience? How could the problem be fixed? Therefore, the purpose of this presentation is to raise awareness through sharing our experience and to educate educational technologists and instructors to support people of colour. Session Link Séance en parallèle 7.3 – Sustaining Positive Change: PSE Humanizing with Humility: The Challenge of Creating Caring, Compassionate, and Critical Educational Spaces in Higher Education (Practice-Oriented) Sarah Driessens (Nipissing University), Michelann Parr (Nipissing University) Keywords: humanizing learning, pedagogy of care, reflective practice Abstract Leading with care and compassion, critically reflecting on our teaching practices, and  collaboration has always been central to our pedagogical practices. It is no wonder that we were both immediately drawn to participate in the #OnHumanLearn project, an initiative designed to humanize learning in higher education. The more we learned/unlearned/relearned to take our professional practice one step further, the more we noticed the divide between our engaged and disengaged learners growing. We also started to notice our own sense of powerlessness intensify alongside feelings of fatigue and frustration for our inability to reach the disengaged. We wondered what we could be doing differently to reach them.  As we reflect on the process, we humbly accept that leading with care also means caring for ourselves, and that any initiative working to humanize higher learning ought to firmly embed and embody co-learning as a relational and reciprocal approach. In this session, we seek to broaden Figure 1 (see below) by paying attention to inequities that became more apparent or were created as we sought to humanize education, the opportunities we have found, and our developing awareness of what is needed to sustain change.  Session Link The Role of Technology in Fostering Communication and Collaboration in Post Secondary Face to Face Classrooms (Research-Oriented) Melanie Opmeer (University of Calgary) Keywords: Technology-enhanced learning environments, Communication, Collaborative Learning, Boundary Object, Social Interdependence Theory, Connectivism, Higher education Abstract The purpose of this qualitative case study is to examine how technology-enhanced learning environments (TELE’s) can foster communication and collaboration in higher education face to face classrooms. A conceptual framework that includes Social Interdependence Theory, the theory of Connectivism and the conception of technology as a boundary object will be used to guide the conduct of this study. The primary research question is: (a) How does educational technology foster communication and collaboration in face to face post-secondary classrooms? Secondary questions in this study are: (b) What is the nature of the collaborative experience for participants engaging with technology? (c) How do instructors and students view technology as a part of fostering communications? This research will serve to increase understanding about incorporating various technologies into post secondary classrooms for knowledge building, encouraging a departure from a traditional lecture format in that context and recognizing the importance of all stakeholders in the education process. Session Link Séance en parallèle 7.4 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – PSE Online Turning to uncertainty for online learning (Practice-Oriented) David Cormier, University of Windsor Keywords: ill-structured problems, wicked problems, rhizomatic learning Abstract Online teaching has increasingly come under fire since the start of the pandemic, both questioning it as a means of effective learning and bemoaning it as a frustrating way to teach. With a huge influx of inexperienced online teachers, forced to teach online for the first time, the need for effective frameworks for faculty development are more important than ever. Teacher’s are concerned with a lack of student engagement and are worried that students are turning to the Internet for answers rather than doing the work. But what if we’re asking the wrong question? Literally. What if the way that we are asking questions is the problem? Existing language on problem setting can be seen as falling into two general categories: Well-structured problems, where the question, the process of solving the problem and the answer are known to the instructor; Ill-structured problems, where one, two or all three of those are not knowable. By looking at the some classic representations of problem setting through the lens of constructivism, this work suggests a framework that will allow us to discuss the intersection of question styles in online learning and, maybe, preparing students to live in an uncertain world. Session Link Séance en parallèle 7.5 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE Feedback Generation through Artificial Intelligence (Research-Oriented) Okan Bulut, Tarid Wongvorachan (University of Alberta) Keywords: feedback, artificial intelligence, learning analytics, educational data mining, assessment Abstract Feedback is an important part in educational assessment that improves student learning. As education changes with the advancement of technology, educational assessment has also adapted accordingly to the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Despite the increasing use of online assessments during the last decade, a limited number of studies have discussed the process of feedback generation as implemented through AI. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual paper to organize and discuss the application of AI in the feedback generation and delivery processes. Among different branches of AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Educational Data Mining (EDM), and Learning Analytics (LA) play the most important roles in the feedback generation process. The process begins with the analysis of students’ data from educational assessments to build a predictive machine learning model with additional features such as students’ interaction with course material using EDM methods to predict students’ learning outcomes. Written feedback can be generated from a model with NLP-based algorithms before being delivered along with non-verbal feedback via a LA dashboard or a digital score report. This paper could contribute to the understanding of the feedback generation process to serve as a venue for the future development of digital feedback. Session Link Perspectives and experiences of equity in the online domain during the pandemic: A multi-institutional study of Canadian Institutions (Research-Oriented) Brad Wuetherick (University of British Columbia), Cherie Woolmer (Mount Royal University), Isabelle Barrette-Ng (University of Windsor), Patrick Maher (Nipissing University), Jill McSweeney-Flaherty (Dalhousie University), Laura Chittle (University of Windsor), Brett McCollum (Mount Royal University), Kaitlin Sibbald (Dalhousie University), Lori Tran (Mount Royal University), Heather Carroll (Nipissing University), Brittany McBride (Nipissing University), Charlotte Foster (Nipissing University), Kyle Scholz (University of Waterloo), Alise de Bie Das (McMaster University), Christopher Ostrowdun (University of Calgary) Keywords: equity, institutional policy, equitable elarning environment, online learning environment, pandemic, COVID-19 Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused a rupture in how post-secondary institutions supported learning. The complexity of shifting to online modes of delivery has been shown to have impacted almost all aspects of learning and teaching. However, there is less evidence in emerging literature that explores the extent to which institutions considered and attended to equity and inclusion within a pandemic context. This paper will present data from a multi-institutional study that examines the impact of the pandemic on providing equitable learning environments online. Data were collected from four Canadian institutions, differing in size and geographic location. Phase 1 and 2 of our study focused on analysis of institutional policy and communications to students at the beginning of the pandemic, interviews with faculty, and surveys of students. Phase 3 of our data (in progress) focuses on interviews with senior administrators. These data reveal the fragmented and isolated conversations that occurred about equitable learning environments and the impact on delivery and engagement. Our interim analysis highlights the need for greater alignment between institutional policy and guidance on how to enact equity in the online environment, and for more robust mechanisms for systematically capturing and responding to the experience of students from equity-seeking groups.

Nous critiquons également l’éducation ouverte pour avoir parfois reproduit des inégalités malgré sa promesse de promouvoir la justice sociale. Mais qu’en est-il de la manière dont l’“ouverture” élimine/détruit les barrières en nous ? De quelle manière l’ouverture nous donne-t-elle du pouvoir de l’extérieur vers l’intérieur? Quand l’ouverture influence-t-elle le changement critique et quand peut-elle échouer à le faire? Au cours de cette session interactive, nous explorerons certaines des choses que l’ouverture rend possibles et qui ne sont souvent pas possibles entre les murs des institutions, et qui peuvent finir par remettre en question et subvertir l’injustice.

Le féminisme intersectionnel considère que les identités sont constituées de multiples dimensions sociales, notamment le genre, la race, la sexualité et la classe (Crenshaw, 1989). En raison de mes tendances féministes intersectionnelles, en tant qu’universitaire, instructeur et concepteur d’apprentissage, j’ai adopté une philosophie de pédagogie féministe. Selon Shrewsbury (1987), la pédagogie féministe est une philosophie des processus d’enseignement/apprentissage qui guide notre choix de pratiques de classe dans lesquelles une communauté d’apprenants est habilitée à agir de manière responsable les uns envers les autres et envers le sujet. La pédagogie féministe nous encourage également à appliquer ce que nous apprenons à l’action sociale. Pour les praticiens de la conception de l’apprentissage et les instructeurs, l’intégration des principes de la pédagogie féministe stimule la conception et le développement d’expériences d’apprentissage plus équitables, inclusives et transformatrices. Le discours lié à la pédagogie féministe dans le domaine de la conception de l’apprentissage vise à faire évoluer le domaine vers une conception “universelle” qui prend en considération les besoins de tous les apprenants tout en promouvant l’agence, l’équité, l’autonomisation et la justice sociale. Séance en parallèle 9.2 “Using Wikimedia as a Teaching Tool: How Wikidata can support Indigenous and low resource languages on the internet” (Utilisation de Wikimedia comme outil d’enseignement : comment Wikidata peut soutenir les langues autochtones et à faibles ressources sur Internet) Sadik Shahadu Keywords: Wikidata, Lexicography, Lexemes, Languages, Wikimedia Abstract Depuis le début de Wikidata en 2012, la base de connaissances multilingue était principalement axée sur les concepts : Les Q-items sont liés à une chose ou une idée, et non au mot qui la décrit. Depuis 2018, Wikidata stocke également un nouveau type de données : des mots, des expressions et des phrases, dans de nombreuses langues, décrits dans de nombreuses langues. Ces informations sont stockées dans de nouveaux types d’entités, appelées Lexèmes (L), Formes (F) et Sens (S). Cette présentation se concentrera sur la façon dont vous pouvez utiliser Wikimedia comme outil d’enseignement, les données lexicographiques de Wikidata : de l’enregistrement des mots, aux lexèmes et au-delà.

This study explored the perceptions of teachers and students about the benefits and challenges of a technology-enhanced pedagogy such as flipped learning. We conducted a small-scale from January to June 2021 with two junior high math classes in a high ELL populated school, at a time when classes in Alberta were shifting between in-person and online learning frequently due to COVID-19. Through a design-based approach, we engaged teachers in reflective conversations and journaling to support ideation of practice, surveyed students surrounding their pre-learning experiences and flipped learning engagement and analyzed data analytics from the web platform used to integrate the flipped learning (i.e., EdPuzzle). The TPACK framework was used for data analysis to explore the relationship between: (1) technology, (2) teaching pedagogy, and (3) content knowledge. The results from this study demonstrated the efficacy of the procedures, instruments and value in extending the study to involve more classes. Research in flipped learning will help inform teachers and schools in any teaching scenario whether in person, when teaching online, in blended learning environments, and when employing emergency remote learning. Session Link 2:45-3:15 – K12 Using Teacher Presence to Engage Online Learners (Practice-Oriented) Leanne Huston, Rochelle Smith, Rhyanon Logan-Goyette (Langley School District &amp; University of Victoria) Keywords: engagement, asynchronous online learning, blended learning, hybrid learning, social constructivism, community of inquiry, teacher presence Abstract Consistently, teachers and researchers have questioned how to engage students who are working in asynchronous online environments. Within our context, we noticed a similar trend: student disengagement in asynchronous activities. The purpose of this presentation is to support teachers in evolving online learning environments as it is not a simple matter of digitizing existing content and placing it online. Pedagogy for online learning includes deliberate planning and implementation of teacher presence, one key component for a successful transition. We have created a resource which outlines strategies to increase teacher presence in online learning environments. Our hope is that educators new to teaching online will be able to engage students asynchronously using these strategies. Session Link 3:15-3:45 – K12, PSE, Society Implementation of Education Technology in Canada: A Comparison with Korea, Finland and the EU (Research-Oriented) Keith Rispin (West Vancouver School District &amp; University of Victoria), Valerie Irvine (University of Victoria) Keywords: technology adoption, technology implementation, educational change, learner equity, government planning, access to education Abstract In this session, we look at how education technology in Canada is distributed to K-12 students and ask whether or not it can be done in a more effective, equitable, and cost-efficient manner. It is recognized that inequity in education already exists across the country, which has been tolerated pre-pandemic, but these inequities have been exacerbated as a result of the pandemic (Stewart, 2020). Our geographical expanse, combined with the decentralized manner in which education in Canada is delivered, creates significant challenges. Education is also a provincial mandate as per the constitution (Government of Canada, 2021). In this session, we will review federal strategies for technology planning in different countries around the world (e.g., Korea, Finland, the European Union, etc.). After providing an environmental scan of these national strategic plans worldwide, we will provide recommendations for national leadership and policy development. Session Link Séance en parallèle 10.2 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE Online 2:15-2:45 Taking Experiential Learning Online During COVID-19 (Research-Oriented) Theodora Kapoyannis, Astrid Kendrick, Patricia Danyluk (University of Calgary) Keywords: online learning, experiential learning, preservice education, COVID-19 Abstract This presentation will share findings from a from a mixed- methods study examining Bachelor of Education students’ experiences with the shift of the second field experience component of their program to a fully online course due to COVID-19. To minimize disruption, four hundred thirty- five preservice teachers pivoted to this fully online field experience course when they were made aware that they would not be completing their one -month practicum in schools. To ensure preservice teachers were able to progress in their program without disruption, the presenters designed a unique online course to replace the traditional in-school practicum. This presentation will explore the key findings of an online survey completed by the preservice teachers who made the shift to an online environment as well as examination of course documents and discussions with instructors during weekly community of practice meetings. Analysis of the data indicated that through the innovation of the newly created online practicum course, preservice teachers developed an enhanced appreciation for online learning. However, in the absence of kindergarten to grade 12 students, the online practicum was unable to provide some of the more practical aspects of an in-school practicum.  Session Link 2:45-3:45 What we do today will change what happens tomorrow – Exploring university teaching during a pandemic to derive recommendations for post-pandemic times (Research-Oriented) Joerdis Weilandt, Sandra Dixon, Richelle Marynowski, Lorraine Beaudin, Rumi Graham, Stavroula Malla, Angeliki Pantazi (University of Lethbridge) Keywords: online teaching, emergency online teaching, equity, resilience, pedagogy of care, online educator roles, trauma-informed teaching Abstract Our faculty research is motivated by a desire to inform future teaching practices and learning support, and thus we’ve been asking ourselves:  How, after the rupture of the pandemic, after our exploration of the immediate impact of teaching in such uncertain, challenging, and changing times, could we engage in practices, pedagogy and policies that help address the gaps and barriers that were revealed? How, after the pandemic, do we go back to “normal”? Will we go back to normal or should we rather capture the moment of disruption in ways that navigate for positive change in education and do something different, do something closer to equitable, resilient, and responsive teaching and learning? Session Link Séance en parallèle 10.3 – Addressing the New Inequities: PSE 2:15-2:45 Co-designing OER with Learners: A Replacement to Traditional College Level Assessments (Practice-Oriented) Kimberlee Carter, Maria Camila Redondo Morant (Conestoga College) Keywords: Open, OER, Open Educational Resources, Co-Construction with Learners, Co-design with Learners Abstract Academic integrity issues in higher education have been reported as increasing as the pandemic and need to learn remotely continues. The use of homework sites like Chegg, that provide learners with answers to tests and assignments increased significantly through 2019 and 2020 (Walsh et al., 2021). Open advocates have been espousing the benefits of open educational resource assignments co-constructed with learners and published in the open prior to the pandemic. These have largely been writing assignments taking the form of blogs with a focus on teaching practices. An example of this phenomenon is the Open Learner Patchbook where learners write blog posts to share in the open (Open Education Global, 2019). A faculty involved in two projects that co-designed Open Education Resources (OER) with learners was curious to know what processes learned could be applied to co-designing OER assignments in their own teaching practice as an alternative to traditional assessments where answers can be found on homework sites. Easton et al. (2019) propose that original assignments encourage learners to complete their own work. This presentation focuses on what was learned in the co-design process with learners and what can be applied to teaching practices in college diploma and certificate courses. Session Link 2:45-3:45 A Critical Examination of Learner-Educator Co-Creation Within a Course (Practice-Oriented) Laura Killam (Queens University), Jess Mitchell (Ontario College of Art and Design University) Keywords: Co-creation, Open Pedagogy, Co-design Abstract Co-creation is an open practice where learners participate in decision-making about aspects of course design, which in our context has included designing assessments and/or determining grades. Co-creation may also include other aspects of course design such as content curation and course planning. Engaging a whole class of learners in co-creation may liberate learners to think critically and develop their evaluative judgment because agency, reflection, and authenticity are embedded in learner-educator interactions. These cognitive skills are essential for graduates to challenge oppression and inequity in their own careers, which has a cascading impact on society. Involving students in decision making also improves learner motivation and engagement in learning. We have witnessed tremendous growth among students through co-creation but have also faced barriers to and criticism of its use. For example, challenges include fostering trusting relationships in large classes, promoting inclusion of diverse voices, and balancing workload. In this discussion, we invite multidisciplinary co-creators to explore strategies for lasting change. We hope to discuss co-creation benefits, challenges, and potential solutions to these challenges. Even though co-creation is a unique experience for each group, ongoing discussion of how to deal with potential barriers may increase our collective readiness to empower future learners. Session Link Séance en parallèle 10.4 2:15-2:45 – Wildcard: Microlearning/Society The use of design-based research to design and evaluate an online microlearning intervention aiming to interrupt COVID-19 vaccine misinformation (Research-Oriented) George Veletsianos (Royal Roads University), Shandell Houlden (Royal Roads University), Jaigris Hodson (Royal Roads University), Darren Reid (University College London), Christiani Thompson (University of Saskatchewan) Keywords: design-based research, learning intervention, COVID-19 misinformation, learning design, iterative design Abstract In this presentation, we report on a design-based research effort to develop educational interventions intended to interrupt the flow of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. Funded by a grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research in February 2020, one aspect of this two-year research project aimed at designing, developing, and evaluating COVID-19 microlearning interventions. By showcasing two iterations of our learning designs, we hope to inform other researchers and practitioners on how we used design-based research to address a societal problem of concern. Specifically, during our session we will (a) describe the principles that we developed to guide the development of the first iteration, (b) present our evaluation of the first iteration, and (c) explain how this evaluation informed the design and development of the second iteration of our learning design. Session Link 2:45-3:15– Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE Méthodes d’évaluation et technologies : vers des activités authentiques, dans un processus itératif en soutien aux apprentissages (Practice-Oriented) Géraldine Heilporn (Université Laval), Audrey Raynault (Université Laval), Alice Mascarenhas (Université de Sherbrooke), Constance Denis (Université de Sherbrooke) Keywords: enseignement supérieur, évaluation, authenticité, activités d’apprentissage, soutien aux apprentissages, français Abstract Dans cette communication, nous présenterons diverses façons permettant de diversifier les méthodes d’évaluation avec les technologies, ce qui a pour effet de renforcer l’authenticité et le développement des compétences d’apprentissage et de littératie du 21e siècle. Les auteurs expliqueront également comment le fait de proposer plusieurs méthodes aux étudiants pour une même évaluation peut contribuer à répondre à leurs différents besoins et préférences sans augmenter la charge de travail des enseignants. En outre, les auteurs discuteront de la manière dont la diversification des méthodes d’évaluation grâce aux technologies entraîne souvent une transformation des modalités d’évaluation vers des processus continus ou itératifs comprenant des rétroactions multiples de la part des personnes enseignantes, en soutien aux apprentissages des étudiants. Session Link 2:45-3:15 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: PSE Quels nouveaux modèles d’affaires pour supporter les communautés de pratique en éducation? (Practice-Oriented) Robert Grégoire, Jacques Cool, Olivier Alfieri (Réseau d’enseignement francophone à distance) Keywords: Français Abstract With the advent of the so-called 21st century skills which involve information and communication technology, the educational sphere has entered a significant turmoil period. Like so many other domains in which established practices have been upended by Internet-distributed innovative platforms, the traditional actors in education are presented with a multiplicity of potential solutions while their own viability is often questioned. Like established teaching institutions, public and private educational organizations face this new reality, particularly in the distance learning domain where the COVID-19 pandemic has exponentially accelerated those transformations. Our not-for-profit distance learning organization, francophone and pan-canadian in nature, has therefore launched a review of its business model seeking to explore four main topics: the organization and benefits ot communities of practice, emerging accreditation alternatives, the continuums of the freemium - premium model, and the intangible benefits of membership. Four online panels hosted by two industry experts and their guests will explore the main issues around those themes. Interviews with organizations similar in nature will document various membership models and fee structure. This presentation will summarize the tendancies and reflective thinking after three of our online panel series. Session Link Séance en parallèle 10.5 2:15-2:45 – Sustaining Positive Change – PSE Online Orlando: Broadening the Conversation on Women’s Writing Through A Scholarly Podcast (Practice-Oriented) Christie Hurrell, Karen Bourrier, Kathryn Holland, Jessica J Khuu (University of Calgary) Keywords: scholarly podcast, women’s writing Abstract Orlando: A Podcast on Women’s Writing focuses on the history of women’s writing from medieval times to the present, with a particular interest in the material conditions that enable women’s writing. Taking cues from the bespoke semantic markup of the digital textbase for which it is named, Orlando: A History of Women’s Writing from the Beginnings to the Present, the podcast stimulates discussion about the conditions of possibility for women’s writing and the goals of feminist literary history. Building on the work of McMenemy (2018), Copeland and MacGregor (2020) and others, both the form and the content of the podcast allow the Orlando team to expand, open, and challenge traditional conceptions of scholarly knowledge, and how this knowledge is communicated. By adopting conventions such as peer review and digital archiving, the podcast asserts itself as a legitimate form of scholarship and as a potential Open Educational Resource; at the same time, its conversational and accessible style challenges norms of publishing, teaching, and learning. In this presentation, the Orlando team will share lessons learned from this technology-enabled, open project and how they see it contributing to a more equitable, diverse and democratic discussion of women writers and women’s writing, broadly construed. Session Link 2:45-3:45 – Addressing the New Inequities A(nother) Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against (or For?) Course Hero (Practice-Oriented) Brenna Clarke Gray (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: educational technology, critical digital pedagogy, open processes, modelling processes Abstract Using Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel’s landmark essay “A Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against Turnitin.” as its foil, this presentation asks participants to apply the same kinds of critiques applied effectively to Turnitin in that piece to Course Hero as we evaluate its claims against the benchmarks of ethical educational technologies. This experiment in collective meaning-making provides a model for critiquing tools that have been carefully marketed but not well-studied by academics, offering a “way in” to these discussions that is rooted in the practical and factual, and not so profoundly shaped by personalities of influence.

In this session, we will review our approach to multi-section open course design and share our experiences working through emergent issues, such as content placement, intellectual property and attribution, etc. We will provide insights and recommendations for institutional leadership and administration, faculty area advisors, technical support staff, and sessional instructors. Session Link Parallel Session 11.2 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching: K12 Online Nonverbal Communication (NVC) and teacher presence in collaborative online learning in primary school (Research-Oriented) Ayşegül Liman Kaban (Bahcesehir University) Keywords: online learning, nonverbal communication, teaching presence, cognitive presence, interaction Abstract Communication process requires a powerful combination of verbal and nonverbal processes that is one of the abilities that every teacher needs to master. In communication, the estimation of sixty-five to seventy percent of the message is received by nonverbal and only thirty to thirty-five percent by verbal communication. This research seeks to analyze the effect of nonverbal communication by primary teachers on the motivation and presence of students in a collaborative online learning environment. The information was gathered by questionnaires and interviews from both instructors and learners. Qualitative research methods were used in this study. The results showed that Nonverbal Communication can be an essential source of inspiration and attention for the learning process of students and a medium to attract their attention. Relying on the research outcomes that show the important role of Nonverbal Communication (NVC) in the teaching and learning process teachers by using the appropriate NVC types, eventually, play a critical role during online collaborative teaching which can affect students’ motivation and higher collaborative learning participation. To accurately convey learning content to students, teachers will have to improve and expand positive interactions. Session Link Creating a Socially Inclusive Learning Environment Through Mobile Technologies for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (Research-Oriented) Rahim Pira (University of Calgary) Keywords: mobile technologies, social inclusion, enclusive education, students with autism Abstract Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopment disorder in Canada, and children with autism have difficulties with communicating and interacting socially with their peers, educators, and parents. One of the latest interventions is the use of mobile technologies in assisting these children in developing their social, communication, language, and other educational skills required for their academic success. However, social inclusion of these students in the classroom is still challenging. Hence, there is a need to determine effective ways of integrating mobile technologies in the classroom to promote the social inclusion of students with ASD. In this case study research, educators, other education professionals, and parents participated in surveys and one-on-one interviews to provide insights about their experiences in meeting students’ diverse needs via mobile technologies. The findings of the study indicated various aspects that are important in promoting the social inclusion of students with ASD via mobile technologies: the importance of balance between mobile technologies and personal interaction; availability of various resources and supports such as research and development, funding, and training; the importance of establishing goals when addressing the needs of students via mobile technologies; and the collaboration among different stakeholders when implementing these technologies. Session Link Séance en parallèle 11.3 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching – PSE Assessment The Power of Teaching Talks: Supporting and Sustaining a University Community Through Critical Conversations Sarah Driessens, Nipissing University Mots-clés: communauté, développement professionnel, enseignement Abstract Certains membres de la communauté universitaire se sont toujours sentis isolés ou déconnectés, mais pour beaucoup d’entre nous, ces sentiments se sont intensifiés lorsque nous sommes passés d’espaces de travail en présentiel à des espaces virtuels (Segal et al, 2021). En réponse à la COVID-19, le Teaching Hub de l’Université Nipissing, un nouveau centre d’enseignement et d’apprentissage, a lancé une série de conférences sur l’enseignement afin de fournir des espaces virtuels pour le développement professionnel et le dialogue, mais aussi pour soutenir et maintenir une communauté universitaire. Ces conférences ont été dirigées par une petite équipe du Teaching Hub qui a réuni des panélistes internes et externes, allant des membres de la faculté et des étudiants aux professionnels et aux activistes communautaires. Avec plus de 500 vues sur huit causeries pédagogiques depuis le début de la pandémie, notre équipe a créé des opportunités de conversation, de pensée critique, de réflexion et de collaboration, le tout dans un espace virtuel. Les causeries sur l’enseignement de l’Université Nipissing constituent un moyen d’aller de l’avant et offrent une nouvelle occasion de tenir des conversations critiques et de créer une dynamique positive autour d’une culture d’excellence en matière d’enseignement et d’apprentissage qui, selon nous, survivra à la pandémie. De plus, les causeries sur l’enseignement ont catalysé la façon dont nous avons envisagé et revu la communauté, ce qui nous a permis de recadrer les opportunités et les défis qui ont émergé de la pandémie.   Séance en parallèle 11.4 – Sustaining Positive Change - Ethics Applying Trauma-informed Design to Online and Face-to-Face Teaching and Learning (Research-Oriented) Suzanne Reinhardt (Simon Fraser University) Keywords: online teaching and learning, trauma-informed practice, trauma-informed, care-centered pedagogy Abstract Schools and educational systems have as their express purpose to provide support for students throughout their learning, but they also have the power to harm. It goes without saying that no student should be harmed in the pursuit of their education. A growing area of research has begun to look at how trauma and retraumatization affect learning in tertiary education in a face-to-face modality. Fewer studies have explored trauma, and its effects, in online classes. This presentation describes a study that uses a constructivist grounded theory approach to examine how college instructors think about and design trauma-informed practices in both their online and face-to-face classes. Using dimensional analysis, the core dimension that emerged from the data was Creating a Learning Environment of Care. A model for the process of Creating a Learning Environment of Care is provided along with a model for Creating a Learning environment of Care online. Theoretical propositions and practical applications are provided based on the data from this research. Session Link Séance en parallèle 11.5 – Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching - PSE The SAMR Model as a Framework for Scaffolding Online Chat (Research-Oriented) Janine Aldous Arantes Keywords: SAMR, technology-enhanced learning, WhatsApp, online learning community Abstract With its increasing reach, accessibility, and frequency of use, WhatsApp can shape the way educators and students share content and communicate in higher education. The purpose of this paper is to report on an Online Learning Community (OLC) using WhatsApp that explored the ‘Implications and Impacts’ component of the Australian Digital Technologies Curriculum with seven pre-service teachers (PST). Through analysis of online chats and thematic analysis, the paper demonstrates the potential use of Puentedura’s (2014) Substitution, Augmentation, Modification and Redefinition (SAMR) model in both online learning communities and as a research method via WhatsApp. This paper reports on an example of the findings of the Substitution prompt, to support the discussion and demonstration. Unique contributions to the discussion, include the interpretive and critical approaches discussed in the paper, in terms of research methods and a guided example of using the SAMR model in a research context. The paper may be of value to both researchers who are interested in a scaffolded means to engage with participants through an online learning community, as well as teachers using technology in educational contexts.

Mais peut-être qu’elle pourrait être plus que toutes ces choses si, en tant que communauté, nous pouvions parler plus ouvertement des frontières et des limites de l’ouverture. Qu’est-ce que cela signifie de dire que nous sommes une communauté d’éducateurs ouverts? Quelle est la limite de l’ouverture, et comment rendre compte de sa définition? Quelles vérités - et celles de qui - restent inexprimées ou non dites, même dans les communautés qui se définissent comme ouvertes? Et qui peut choisir l’ouverture en toute sécurité? En proposant une auto-ethnographie sur la perte d’une grossesse dans le contexte de la pandémie universitaire comme point de départ de cette exploration, cette présentation cherche à définir les marges et les limites de l’ouverture et à s’interroger sur les avantages d’élargir la portée et les possibilités de l’ouverture dans nos institutions.

Cependant, il est possible de penser que les inégalités numériques se configurent en amont de l’utilisation des technologies par les acteurs éducatifs. Dans cette perspective systémique, les inégalités d’usage représentent l’aboutissement d’un processus de configuration des inégalités numériques qui débute avec la conception des technologies éducatives. Pour en rendre compte, nous nous inspirons des études sur la ” mise en forme sociale de la technologie ” dans une perspective critique, en empruntant la métaphore du ” script ” développée par Akrich et Latour (1992). Appliquée aux inégalités numériques en éducation, la conception et l’utilisation des technologies éducatives constituent un seul et même processus au cours duquel des scripts de pouvoir sont progressivement forgés et stabilisés par certains acteurs (industriels, politiques, informatiques, éducatifs) au détriment d’autres, notamment les acteurs éducatifs issus de milieux défavorisés. Ainsi, les inégalités numériques résultent de la plus ou moins grande convergence entre les acteurs éducatifs visés par la conception des technologies éducatives et ceux qui les utilisent.

J’étais enthousiaste à l’idée de retourner dans le milieu du cursus scolaire pour aider à soutenir le besoin perçu d’apprentissage ouvert et en ligne à l’époque de l’apprentissage à distance. Cependant, j’ai rapidement appris que les principes de l’intervention de conception de l’apprentissage ouvert (OLDI) et les résultats de ma recherche (Roberts, 2019) avaient plus de perspectives dans l’enseignement supérieur que dans les contextes du cursus scolaire. En passant par des postes contractuels à court terme, je suis maintenant concepteur pédagogique contractuel à l’UTR (Université Thompson Rivers), où je soutiens le parcours du diplôme ZTC Associate Science. Mes expériences d’écriture réflexive et d’apprentissage ouvert en matière de pédagogie ouverte des pandémies (Havemann et Roberts, 2021), de pratiques participatives ouvertes, notamment les blogues (DeWaard et Roberts, 2021), les livres d’images collaboratifs (Roberts et al, 2020), Twitter (Brown et Roberts, 2022) et les podcasts (Roberts et Neutzling, 2022), ainsi que la conception d’apprentissage ouvert (Roberts, 2021 ; Brown et al, 2021) ont inspiré mes futures possibilités de recherche ouverte (Roberts et al, 2022). Cet exposé racontera comment les expériences de la pandémie m’ont aidé à envisager le potentiel de l’effet d’entraînement qui m’a encouragé à équilibrer mon identité de concepteur d’apprentissage ouvert avec ma réalité professionnelle. Les participants seront encouragés à réfléchir à leurs parcours d’apprentissage ouvert et à la manière de défendre l’apprentissage ouvert dans l’esprit et comme une vocation.

Afin d’améliorer l’accessibilité de ces cours pour tous les étudiants, l’usage de pratiques pédagogiques inclusives par les enseignants vise à éliminer les barrières potentielles aux apprentissages et à l’engagement des étudiants en répondant à des besoins diversifiés. Toutefois, la recherche sur les pratiques pédagogiques inclusives est encore peu développée, quelles que soient les modalités de cours ou les ordres d’enseignement. Cette étude analyse l’évolution des pratiques pédagogiques inclusives engendrées par le contexte pandémique en enseignement collégial, suivant une approche méthodologique de recherche mixte. Les perceptions d’étudiants de 10 établissements d’enseignement collégial au Québec (Canada) ont été recueillies sur les usages de pratiques pédagogiques inclusives dans leurs cours avant et pendant la pandémie, par questionnaires (n = 1242) et entrevues (n = 25).

Session Link 2:45-3:45 Aspirations for post pandemic teaching and learning: Stepping stones for future possibilities Lisa Gedak (Royal Roads University &amp; Kwantlen Polytechnic University), Leeann Waddington, (Kwantlen Polytechnic University) Keywords: Appreciative Inquiry, Online Learning, Educational Development, Tech-enhanced Practices, COVID-19 Pivot Abstract COVID-19 disrupted educational contexts worldwide, providing a possible catalyst for the transformation of teaching and learning. However, without thoughtful reflection and purposeful planning, a post-pandemic return to the status quo seemed likely. The presenters believe that what we focus on determines our perception, and a vision for an ideal future supports purposeful action in that direction. This session shares the findings of two distinctive studies. Conducted in unique contexts, both applied an Appreciative Inquiry (AI) approach to explore experiences during the pandemic to identify what is needed for future learning environments. Gedak (2021) examined a British Columbian K-12 school community’s experiences during the pandemic and utilized an AI SOAR approach with hopes of positively impacting future district decisions related to education delivery. Waddington (2021) guided a group of post-secondary faculty through an AI-based professional development series to support them to reflect on their initial experience teaching online to identify strengths and opportunities for development and support future adoption of technology and online delivery models. The respective findings suggest applicability in other contexts. This session aims to foster dialogue around maximizing the impact of pandemic teaching and learning experiences to meet the needs of diverse learners in a changing world.

Through a self-study, they conducted an autobiographical narrative inquiry to explore and reflect how digital technology changes their pedagogical practices in early elementary level Chinese language classes. Drawing on Multiliteracies and the notion of new literacies, they look at the multiple literacies embedded in their teaching in the digital space. This paper will shed light on pedagogical practices in Chinese complementary schools in Canada, especially for the post pandemic era. Session Link 2:45-3:45 Indigenizing Internationalization and Internationalizing Indigenization: Insights from a Virtual Study Abroad to Ireland, Jamaica, and Aotearoa/New Zealand (Research-Oriented) Michael Cottrell, Kristine Dreaver-Charles (University of Saskatchewan) Keywords: Internationalization, Indigenization, Higher Education teaching and learning, Study Abroad, Epistemological third spaces, Decolonizing curriculum Abstract This proposal aligns with the themes “The Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching” and “Sustaining Positive Change” and reports on the work of a faculty member and an instructional designer from the University of Saskatchewan, where Indigenization and internationalization are leading institutional priorities. We consider possibilities for greater collaboration between these disciplinary and programmatic imperatives for mutual benefit which the shift to virtual learning during the pandemic enabled. We explore the capacity of Virtual Study Abroad course design to synthesize Indigenous and Western pedagogies and methodologies to conceive innovative curriculum consistent with the negotiation of epistemological third spaces through the design of a Virtual Study Abroad course focusing on educational systems in Ireland, Jamaica and New Zealand. Themes emerging from the data include the capacity of virtual learning to enhance the democratization of knowledge and the potential of participatory pedagogies and innovative assessment approaches to decolonize curriculum. Ultimately, we hope that this work will inform new institutional models, whereby Indigenization strategies serve to decolonize internationalization programs and Indigenization efforts are advanced through innovative programming emanating from internationalization imperatives and initiatives. Such a reconceptualization holds the promise of mobilizing Higher Education in the service of social justice and the ‘global good’. Session Link Séance en parallèle 14.4 – Sustaining Positive Change: Open Provocations and Perspectives: A Work in Progress Learning Design Framework (Practice-Oriented) Michael Paskevicius (University of Victoria), Michelle Harrison (Thompson Rivers University), and Irwin DeVries (Royal Roads University) Keywords: learning design, open pedagogy, Critical Pedagogy Abstract In this presentation we provide an update on the development of an experimental variation on the open textbook concept. Originally introduced as an “untextbook” in its early stages, as a customized WordPress site we are now calling it an open digital learning resource. Both scholars and graduate students have been invited to contribute as well as participate in further developing the concept through the submission of provocations. With a focus on learning design, the resulting digital publication is designed in a manner to permit an ongoing evolution, extension and reframing of the original content in learning environments. In response to the provocations, students have been invited, through a series of prompts, to engage with this resource as part of their coursework in a process of ongoing co-creation in a manner consistent with open licensing and pedagogy. In particular it is designed to encourage student responses from critical perspectives including issues, lenses, role perspectives, settings. While the focus of this text is learning design, we envision that the model can be adapted to any other field of inquiry where knowledge is continually evolving or problematized and there is a desire to invite and incorporate alternative perspectives in the educational setting. Session Link Open Learning Design: Principles &amp; Practices (Practice-Oriented) Verena Roberts (University of Calgary &amp; Thompson Rivers University), Leo Havemann (University College London), Helen Dewaard (Lakehead University &amp; University of British Columbia) Keywords: open learning design, open educational practices, learning design Abstract This presentation will consider principles of open learning design, as explored in our forthcoming book chapter which considers the position of open learning designers as ‘Thirdspace professionals’, and highlights our lens as open advocates, open researchers as well as learning designers within higher education (HE) contexts. An intentional, reflective, and open learning design can provide the impetus for a “rethink and redesign” (Ladson-Billings, 2021, p. 73) of teaching and learning environments and curricula. Session Link How faculty perceptions of and experiences with open access and predatory publications impact teaching and learning (Research-Oriented) Richard Hayman (Mount Royal University) Keywords: Open access, Scholarly communications, Academic publishing, Teaching and learning Abstract This presentation presents the results of a research study examining scholars’ awareness and attitudes toward open access (OA) and predatory publishing at a teaching-focused, undergraduate-only university. These faculty (n=154) responded to closed- and open-ended survey questions about their experiences and knowledge using and identifying both quality open access OA and predatory publishing resources as part of their research, teaching, and assessment practices. The results show that while generally supportive of OA, faculty continue to misunderstand OA and are unlikely to use OA resources in their teaching or research. Worse, many did not express strong confidence in their ability to identify and predatory publishers nor to explain predatory publishing to students. Ultimately, scholars may be ill-equipped to teach students and early researchers about open access and predatory publishing practices. This session will primarily highlight the study results focused on the teaching and learning impacts, and seek to address some implications for how new researchers are to gain the essential skills and knowledge needed to navigate the academic publishing landscape. Session Link Conestoga OER Teaching Case Journal: Creating a peer-reviewed, openly licensed, and accessible teaching case journal at Conestoga College (Practice-Oriented) Kevin McDermott, Jane Gravill, Fatih Yegal, Kimberlee Carter (Conestoga College) Keywords: OER, Teaching Case Journal, Case Writing, Openly licensed business cases Abstract Conestoga College is a student-centric community college that services a diverse population of students from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds in south-western Ontario, Canada. To ensure equality for students with less financial means by keeping course material costs low, a group of faculty and administrative staff have created an initiative to encourage faculty members to create quality, OER pedagogical business cases for use in courses. This multi-faceted case writing, and publishing initiative includes three operational pillars: 1) case workshops to help faculty members develop their case writing skills; 2) case roundtable discussions to encourage collaboration and feedback on in-development cases, and; 3) the Conestoga OER Teaching Case Journal, a peer-reviewed, open and accessible, teaching case journal, targeting the submission of cases from a variety of business disciplines. In this session, we will discuss our initial findings related to the efficacy of this initiative and will solicit feedback and collaboration from colleagues. Session Link Séance en parallèle 14.5 – Wildcard: Open 2:15-2:45: Wildcard: 10-min ALT Format Fostering Resiliency in Online Learners: A Blended Test Anxiety Intervention Jacqueline Yu Keywords: test anxiety, online learning, K-12 schools Abstract Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many students are facing potential learning gaps due to periods of emergency teaching, and they lack practice with regulating exam stress. In connection, test anxiety concerns remain a pressing issue in schools. In Alberta, students were initially scheduled to write provincially mandated diploma examinations during the 2021-2 school year; January exams were cancelled, but a decision has not yet been made about upcoming administrations (Government of Alberta, 2021). Although various forms of e-proctoring have garnered interest, research has yet to determine whether such conditions help prepare students for in-person testing or if they foster greater anxiety (Eaton &amp; Turner, 2020). Developed for an online K-12 school, this presentation will highlight a blended test anxiety resource intended to help grade 12 students face in-person standardized testing with confidence. For its asynchronous component, students receive access to web-based content based on the key components of Putwain et al.’s (2014) Strategies to Tackle Exam Pressure and Stress (STEPS). On in-person exam days, students will also receive access to regulatory tools through calming kits. Session Link The role of inquiry-based information literacy curriculum design in fostering self-efficacy in the digital learning environment Marta Samokishyn (Saint Paul University) Keywords: Information literacy, Online learning, Self-efficacy Abstract Students’ motivation and engagement have been a subject of concern in online learning, especially over the last two years (Means &amp; Neisler, 2021). The inquiry-based approach in information literacy education has shown to increase students’ self-efficacy and sense of agency (Leat, 2017), promote engagement and cognitive presence, as essential building blocks for the development of students’ critical thinking skills. This presentation will discuss the development of an inquiry-based IL curriculum for the credit-bearing collaborative 1st-year undergraduate course in Social Sciences and Humanities. The presenter will discuss how inquiry-based learning can facilitate self-efficacy in the digital learning environments, as we move forward. Session Link 2:45-3:45 Learning In the Open: The Journey of Creating and Implementing Open Web-Based Portfolio Templates (Practice-Oriented) Melanie Laurie (Fraser Health), Jamie Drozda (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: ePortfolio, digital competencies, open Abstract The authors will discuss the process of building WordPress sites as ePortfolio templates for faculty and students to adopt in their coursework and as digital spaces to showcase their learning. Eportfolios themselves are not a novel innovation of the pandemic, however, they were used in creative ways to replace field work, practicums, and art galleries. The authors saw a desperate need for faculty and students to be supported with open source portfolio technologies. In addition, many faculty and students had little technical expertise or funds to develop a website or ePortfolio, which is why the authors developed a series of clonable WordPress ePortfolio template sites. Initially, their aim was to support students by creating open ePortfolio templates with a simple structure and step-by-step instructions for website building, artifact curation and reflection. As they implemented the ePortfolio templates into their respective workplaces, they humbly realized how large some of the technical and pedagogical gaps in understanding can be and so an iterative approach was taken to refine the authors’ instructional process, and the templates themselves were revamped to be more user friendly for the beginner content creator.

La REL co-créée par la classe est le résultat d’un important travail de classe, la planification d’un cours du curriculum des études canadiennes et mondiales de l’Ontario, de la 7e à la 12e année. La création de cette REL s’inscrit dans une évolution plus large de la conception du cours vers des pratiques pédagogiques ouvertes et des stratégies de notation collaborative.   L’enseignant du cours et les étudiants qui y contribuent réfléchissent à la manière dont la mise en œuvre d’une pratique pédagogique ouverte, le fait de privilégier les processus d’apprentissage et la collaboration ont eu un impact sur leur environnement d’enseignement et d’apprentissage. Les étudiants partageront leurs expériences avec la pédagogie ouverte modélisée, les opportunités de réflexion critique et la collaboration multidirectionnelle. Pour les candidats enseignants, ces expériences ont encouragé la réflexion sur les complexités de la mise en œuvre d’une pratique ouverte et sur les façons dont ces approches pourraient être mises en œuvre dans le domaine de la maternelle à la 12e année, tout en offrant également un aperçu des divers défis liés à une telle pratique. Pour l’enseignant, les changements dans la conception du cours ont également apporté des avantages, des opportunités et des défis. L’expérience a mis en évidence la complexité de la pédagogie ouverte en pratique dans l’enseignement postsecondaire.   Practicum During the Pandemic: Zooming In (Practice-Oriented) Christine Ho Younghusband (University of Northern British Columbia) Keywords: practicum, teacher education, remote learning, video conferencing, program evaluation, policy Abstract Universities in British Columbia pivoted to remote online learning in March 2020 and remained online in the upcoming school year. Teacher Education Programs also pivoted to remote online learning, with exception to practicum. Teacher candidates returned K-12 schools for practicum as of the Fall 2020 term while coursework at universities remained online. Teacher candidates were placed in their home communities, if possible, for practicum. At one university, some teacher candidates were formally observed and supported by the practicum mentor remotely due to limited staffing, location of placement, and COVID safety protocols. Formal observations and pre- and post-conferences with the Teacher Candidate were held on Zoom. This session will discuss the pros and cons of remote observations for practicum, privacy and policy issues, and recommendations regarding the use of video conferencing applications for formal observations. Session Link Equipping Pre-Service Teacher Candidates for a Post-Pandemic Reality: Building e-Pedagogy Skills and Connecting Theory to Praxis (Practice-Oriented) Karen Roeck (Heritage Christian Online School), Nina Pak Lui (Trinity Western University) Keywords: educational technology, e-pedagogy, teacher education, practicum Abstract This practice-oriented session addresses two identified gaps: (a) the absence of e-pedagogy skill development in teacher education programs (e.g., strategies specific to online teaching) (Serdyukov, 2015); and (b) a lack of ongoing opportunities for teacher education students to apply content and pedagogical knowledge in real classrooms guided by mentor teachers. This session is relevant to the conference themes of “The Transitions of Online Learning and Teaching” and “Sustaining Positive Change.” Our work was guided by three inquiry questions: What skills do 21st century teachers need to create inclusive, equitable, human-centred learning environments and serve students in a variety of modalities? Where should pre-service teachers complete their field experience to best prepare them for all teaching and learning opportunities in British Columbia (BC)? What are the impacts on professional learning of pre-service teachers when they have field experiences with online educators?

Our MOOC combines synchronous and asynchronous learning activities and rich resources on various topics and issues in graduate education and supervisory relationships. Academics join an online community of practice (OCoP) to discuss and explore transdisciplinary strategies for effective graduate supervision and mentoring. The focus of this paper is the QGS MOOC Webinar series that brings faculty and expert panelists together in real time to discuss and explore complex issues in graduate supervision.  The Weekly Webinar series invites supervisors into live conversations with peers, course instructors and expert panelists. Faculty attendance was high every week. During a demanding semester, busy faculty regularly showed up to engage in dynamic conversations. The Webinars increased supervisors’ sense of belonging in the OCoP and enhanced the value of the course. Online faculty development offers significant opportunities for democratizing knowledge about graduate supervision. The open and online design of the MOOC and Webinar series increased access to a broad and diverse community of professors and enhanced possibilities for collaboration across institutions that leveraged expertise and capacity in graduate supervision.  Session Link Séance en parallèle 15.3 - Wildcard: PSE Online From Crime Scene to the Laboratory: Travel CSI style!

(Practice-Oriented) Rebekah Bennetch (University of Saskatchewan), Zach Keesey Keywords: open educational resource, technical communication, grammar, writing, report writing, public speaking, H5P, case studies Abstract Like all educators in 2020, we struggled with the transition to online learning. The sudden shift to a remote, asynchronous learning environment was a challenge we often had to meet; however, from that challenge came an opportunity.  Instead of staying stuck in our remote course mistakes, we used them to create something new: an attractive, accessible, and inclusive Open Education Resource (OER) textbook for our technical communication course. Our presentation will walk through our process of taking a lackluster online course and turning it into an effective textbook.    Additionally, we will share tips and strategies for designing H5P activities and case studies that stimulate higher order thinking, discuss best practices for making an online text accessible and inclusive, and explain how we sorted through an unlimited amount of existing OER texts to create our own.  Session Link Show Me Your Crystal Ball: An Environmental Scan for Usefulness (Practice-Oriented) Jenni Hayman (Cambrian College) Keywords: post-pandemic teaching, multi-modal learning, literature review Abstract In the past year, there have been a lot of articles. A lot of shared ideas and many strategies, tips, and tricks focused on how to manage the continuity of post-secondary teaching and learning during a relentless global pandemic. It’s my sense that we’re not anywhere near the end of this pandemic, despite what some in positions of political leadership might wish or pretend. There is more uncertainty to come, possibly significant uncertainty as colleges and universities begin to pick up the pieces of their shattered perceptions and begin the difficult work of personal and institutional recovery. It is hard to imagine anyone in Canadian higher education (learners, faculty, staff, administrators, employer partners) that has not been negatively impacted by COVID-19 decisions, changes in practice, and shifting priorities. It has been a messy two-plus years of chaos. There has been no lack of advice–and perhaps now might be a good time to sort through some of the recommendations, check the accuracy and usefulness of predictions and strategies, and begin a collection of works that support collective success for post-secondary futures. The purpose of this session is to share some useful works and collect and share new favourites from participants. Session Link Opening a Seminal Work for the Next Century (Practice-Oriented) Kristine Dreaver-Charles, Monique Mayer (University of Saskatchewan) Keywords: Open textbooks, Open education resources (OER), H5P, Equitable access, Catalysts of open Abstract This contribution is situated at the University of Saskatchewan, where Open Education Resources have been supported since 2014-2015. During the pandemic we began the work of translating The Lymphatic System of the Dog, by Dr. Hermann Baum into English. Originally published in 1918, Dr Baum’s book has been transitioned into Pressbooks, with the addition of ancillary resources. Balancing the legacy of Dr. Baum’s research with our own innovations in assessment and design engages new generations of learners and practitioners. The benefits for faculty and graduate students in designing and publishing openly must also be acknowledged. Locally designed and produced open education resources created with and by our university community is of significance to the academy. The use of open textbooks in university classes establishes a discourse and refinement of knowledge ensuring quality resources are designed and shared.

Abstract The “Conversational Framework”, which represents a learning design framework for teaching and learning processes, could be used as a guide for integrating Open Educational Resources (OER) into education. With the growing tendency toward open and adaptable pedagogy, OER have achieved popularity as a method for supporting students’ access and enabling contributions to knowledge. These resources provide students with the possibility to play an active role in creating knowledge. However, the development of an effective environment to foster the process of learning can benefit from being grounded in a theoretical framework. The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of the “Conversational Framework” (Laurillard 2002, 2012) in designing effective educational experiences and specifically how OER may support students’ learning and engagement. Moreover, it will be discussed how this framework can help teachers consider how to design open learning experiences. Session Link 5:00-5:30 – Addressing the New Inequities - PSE Defining Diversity in the Development of a Health Education Media Library (Practice-Oriented) Danielle Dilkes (University of Western Ontario) Keywords: open education, media, representation, cataloguing, participatory design, diversity, diversity theatre Abstract This interactive session is a reflection on the complexity of diversity and representation in the design of educational materials using the example of the development of the Health Education Media Library, a project funded by the 2021 eCampus Virtual Learning Strategy. This project was a response to the challenges of finding high-quality, diverse and inclusive media while creating health education content. The proposed solution was a community-sourced library of images, video and audio that would be made widely available for health educators. As the project evolved, however, this simplistic approach revealed the complexity of diversity work in higher education, starting with the not simple task of defining diversity, how that definition can codify identity, and the implications of that definition including some groups and excluding others. This session will provide an opportunity to reflect on some of the questions and considerations that were raised through the initial phase of the Health Education Media Library project, linking them to broader diversity discourse in higher education, curricular design, and media cataloguing. The session will reflect on the importance of how we approach this work and who is included, concluding with a reimagining of the participatory design of the project.

Change research is a form of praxis - the space and processes by which theory and practice are enacted, embodied and realized in a reflexive manner by implementing and studying innovation in education. I focus on how and why design-based research – a collection of methodological principles and approaches to studying innovative educational interventions in complex, real-world settings – bridges the theory-practice gap in sponsoring praxis and innovation in technology-enabled education. Séance en parallèle 16.2 Open Education – Title Forthcoming Leo Havemann, University College London Abstract The UNESCO 2019 OER Recommendation includes a key area of focus for member states, ‘Developing supportive policy for OER’. At the same time, much of the work of open education takes place ‘on the ground’, within institutions which may or may not themselves have developed supportive policies. This workshop relates to a doctoral study about the relationship between open education and policy in higher education institutions around the world. Context and rationale underlying the study will be discussed but for most of the workshop participants will be encouraged to share their experiences and views. Session Link Séance en parallèle 16.3 Decolonisation of learning spaces: It’s not about knowing more but knowing better Marguerite Koole (University of Saskatchewan), John Traxler (UNESCO, Wolverhampton University), Shri Footring (Independent Researcher) Keywords: decolonization, research methods, card sorts, personal construct theory, digital learning spaces Abstract Working alongside members of communities who are remote and/or marginalized from the dominant socio-economic powers, the long-term goal of the Decolonisation of Digital Learning Spaces project is to empower communities in choosing, adopting, developing, and/or appropriating culturally appropriate and sustainable digital learning technologies. Before we can co-envision useful options, however, we must first know what questions to ask and how to ask. It is necessary, therefore, to find appropriate, efficient, and innovative approaches to better understand community needs and values. This paper describes the preliminary planning of the research project in creating an international network of community members, activists, and researchers, and in identifying and testing methods for eliciting needs, values, and ways of understanding the world. Selected methods must allow the researchers to step outside their own pre-conceived understandings to avoid dominating or imposing meaning upon the participants’ understandings. In this presentation, we describe 1) the goals and concerns that were the impetus for the project, 2) the nascent network, 3) potential knowledge elicitation methods, and 4) the repeated single-criterion card sort method as the first method that will be piloted. Session Link Séance en parallèle 16.4 Introduction to Pressbooks Verena Roberts, Barbara Brown (University of Calgary) Keywords: Pressbooks, adaptation, course design Abstract Are you considering using or making pressbooks – but do not know where to start? This workshop is designed for those new or considering the use of pressbooks in their courses. We will begin with an overview of the many ways in which you could adopt pressbooks, then we will jump into using and adapting pressbooks for ourselves. This workshop is designed to explore the potential of using pressbooks in any course. This workshop will encourage all participants to develop awareness about the potential for using pressbooks in their personal learning context by providing an overview and an opportunity to learn by playing in a pressbooks sandbox. Anyone interested in learning about pressbooks is welcome to attend this workshop. Session Link Pause (12:30 – 12:45) Unconference (aka: EdCamp) (12:45 – 1:45) Pause (1:45 – 2:15) Séances en parallèle 17 (2:15 – 4:15) Séance en parallèle 17.1 (2:15-4:15) Analyzing and Visualizing Survey Questions Using Open-Source Software Okan Bulut, University of Alberta Keywords: survey, statistics, data visualization, open-source software, psychometrics Abstract In social sciences, surveys are widely used by researchers to collect information from or about people to describe, compare, or explain their knowledge, feelings, values, and behaviours. Before using survey data to draw inferences, researchers need to evaluate the quality of survey data through statistical analysis and visualizations. This workshop aims to provide a step-by-step guideline on how to analyze and visualize survey questions using open-source software programs. The workshop will begin with a brief summary of statistical techniques and data visualization tools used for analyzing survey data. Then, participants will be provided with hands-on training on how to use open-source software programs (e.g., JASP and jamovi) to visualize and analyze survey data. The target audience for this session includes graduate students, researchers interested in analyzing survey data, and practitioners working with data from surveys, questionnaires, and psychological scales. Session Link Séance en parallèle 17.2 3:15-4:15 OER in the Plague Years – Lessons and a Hands-on Workshop Joshua Halpern, Yasin Dahi, LibreTexts Keywords: OER, Textbooks, Remixing Abstract This workshop will describe how one large OER project encountered and met the challenge of the plague years, growing its community, offerings and technology. Participants get a first, hands-on introduction to the system and learn how to start working with it. In the past two years community members have met the challenge of switching to distance learning using wiki based libraries, remixing, editing and creating custom courses. Collaborative text creation exploded. Key improvements were made in ancillary technologies including homework. A common platform allowed rapid introduction of new features. Ease of use by everyone, everywhere became the basic accessibility issue. That applies to making it as easy as possible for faculty to create and for students to reach and use materials that serve their training and needs. It was especially important to provide multiple channels for learner access. Books are available online, via printed books, ebooks, embeddable into LMSs and can be mailed on an SD card as well housed in as a Raspberry Pi with a hotspot. It has been an intense and interesting two years. Session Link Séance en parallèle 17.3 2:15-3:15 An Innovative Approach to Academic Publishing: Open Books Suzan Koseoglu (University of Greenwich) &amp; Royce Kimmons (Bringham Young University) Keywords: Open educational practice, Open scholarship, Open books, Academic publishing Abstract In this interactive and creative workshop, participants will explore open books, an innovative approach to academic book publishing. Open books are open not only in terms of their open access licenses, but also in terms of an openness to finding different ways of engaging in academic work. Session Link 3:15-4:15 Share Access! Using Bookdown to Remove Barriers and Open Up Learning Kelly Marjanovic, Barish Golland, Colin Madland (Trinity Western University) Keywords: elearning, bookdown, accessibility, GitHub, course design, R Abstract Access denied! You do not have permission to view this file!  Sound familiar? Imagine how our learners must feel as they take all the necessary steps to begin a course, only to encounter barrier after barrier. Low Wi-Fi causing network disruptions, logging in to multiple sites to view resources, trying to locate a specific unit topic, and having screen display issues.  In this session we will present our use of Bookdown, an open-source R package that helped us remove some of the barriers for learners and instructors. We will share how we moved some of our courses to Bookdown after hearing our Nigerian students had limited access to Moodle. We will explore the many advantages of using Bookdown, such as accessing course content outside of our LMS, providing a collaborative infrastructure for design and maintenance (GitHub), displaying content as a searchable book, and providing accessible versions (ePub/PDF). We will explore other advantages, as well as some challenges we have come across.   The second half of this workshop will allow participants to present their own course challenges. Using Liberating Structures, participants will draw from the expertise of colleagues and consider recommendations to address barriers for learning. Session Link Pause (4:15– 4:30) Séances en parallèle 18 (4:30 – 5:30) Séance en parallèle 18.1 Using 360 Spaces to Engage Learners with Virtual Puzzle Escape Rooms Lillian Chumbley (Trent University), Jane Tyerman (University of Ottawa) Keywords: VIPER, Escape Room, 360 Abstract This presentation will demonstrate the process for developing 360 Virtual Interactive Puzzle Escape Rooms (VIPER) for use in education. VIPERs can provide opportunities for learners to engage in experiential learning in a scalable and more cost effective than traditional methods. Unlike specialized escape room programs, VIPERs provide a 360 space and allow for anyone online to access the completed game and for development files, maps and resources to be easily shared. The presenters will take participants through the process for mapping games, creating or find assets and developing a simple 360 space through a collaborative process. The workshop will also cover principles of VIPERs for educational use and intersections with Game Theory. Session Link Séance en parallèle 18.2 CRICKET: An OER for Educational Developers and Instructional Designers Brenda Smith, Marie Bartlett, Carolyn Ives (Thompson Rivers University) Keywords: OER, educational development, curriculum development, open education, open educational practices Abstract In May 2019, Thompson Rivers University (TRU) offered its first version of a week-long course (re)design workshop. Recognizing we had been primarily using resources from other institutions, we opted to create our own resources via a one-day facilitated writing sprint. The project grew from being conceptualized as a few stand-alone documents to a large online open educational resource and space for educational developers, instructional designers, and teaching faculty to form a community for open practices. Moving beyond offering resources simply for course design, we decided to create an OER that encompasses three main areas of curriculum planning and design: composition, mapping, and alignment of learning outcomes at the course, program, and institutional levels; choice and alignment of instructional strategies and learning activities; and alignment of outcomes assessment at all levels. This workshop will share the CRICKET (or Course Resource Kit) OER, and session participants will interact with the site through a targeted worksheet and discussion to explore its various features, offer feedback, and share ideas. It will serve to bridge the field of educational development and curriculum development with OER while demonstrating how a range of faculty development professionals can collaborate to create meaningful resources for their campus and beyond. Session Link Séance en parallèle 18.3 The eLearning Design Charrette: A H5P Workshop JR Dingwall, University of Saskatchewan Abstract Creating engaging interactive online activities used to require either expensive eLearning authoring tools, comprehensive web development knowledge and skills, or both. However, this is no longer the case. Participants in the eLearning Design Charrette are invited to complete small challenges using a free and open-source authoring tool, H5P. Originating from the Architectural Faculty of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in the 19th century (Roggama, 2014), design charrettes have long been successfully applied to complex, complicated, and controversial design problems. A design charrette is “a time-limited, multiparty design event organised to generate a collaborative produced plan for a sustainable community” (Condon, 2008). In the context of this workshop, the characteristics of design charrettes - knowledge creation and sharing, unconscious intuition, creativity, and working in the flow - will be applied to create sustainable learning asset examples for the wider OTESSA community. This workshop begins with an overview of design charrettes for eLearning, after which participants attempt to complete provided challenges individually or in groups. Then, facilitated by an experienced instructional designer and H5P enthusiast, participants will share and critique completed challenges. All levels of experience with H5P are welcome in this encouraging environment where everyone can share their interest, questions, and expertise. Condon, P. M. (2012).

Students can showcase their achievements, instructors can assess their students, and both learners and educators can engage in deep learning and critical reflection. As a capstone project at the end of a course or program of studies, the ePortfolio is an innovative instructional strategy that enables students to learn with the technology while learning about it. As part of a growing movement, ePortfolio pedagogy includes instructional practices that are aligned with the 21st century and encourages students to rely on their environment and each other to learn and co-construct knowledge. This digital pedagogy is an effective form of professional self-development that aims to help educators leverage on what they have to offer in their own practice as they rely on a value-based approach to teaching. The ePortfolio is prominently positioned as an innovative way for educators to relearn their craft, design learning, and facilitate online instruction. ePortfolio Pedagogy: Stimulating a Shift in Mindset Rita Zuba Prokopetz, Athabasca University Keywords: ePortfolio pedagogy, mindset, community, knowledge production, knowledge mobilization Abstract As digital pedagogy and instructional strategy, electronic portfolios (ePortfolios) help educators organize instruction, facilitate teaching, and enhance learning. As students develop their projects, they learn to overcome challenges with the technology and to embrace the pedagogy that promotes learning. The process of developing ePortfolios helps foster a community of learners in online spaces. Decades-old research shows that the ePortfolio development process enhances knowledge production, makes visible knowledge application, and capacitates knowledge mobilization. The ePortfolio technology makes affordances for interaction and reflection, encourages both analytical thinking and the questioning of assumptions related to online learning. As multipurpose tools (assessment, accountability, collaboration), ePortfolios are part of a movement that aims to reimagine the way we teach and learn in internet spaces. ePortfolio pedagogy, undergirded by interaction and reflection, integrates authentic learning episodes in digital spaces and enables practitioners to engage in democratizing and mobilizing knowledge. The ePortfolio pedagogy is inclusive, embraces equity, and encourages the sharing of stories, ideas, and opinions among learners. As students engage in idea generation in terms of choice of platform, layout, content, and artefacts, they experience a shift in mindset that capacitates a can-do attitude toward their learning and project completion in online spaces. Transitioning, and Why It’ll Never Be Enough Christian Metaxas, Trent University Keywords: rhetoric, reflection, learning, transitioning Abstract For the last 2 years we’ve peppered each other with polite euphemisms designed to soften the idea that our lives have been irrevocably altered. Phrases like “the before times” and the “new normal” now litter our public consciousness. It perpetuates the idea that if we strap ourselves in, we can white-knuckle our way through the turbulence and successfully transition. A transition is a phase during which something shifts from one state or condition to another. In his video essay, Chrisitan Metaxas argues that to think of contemporary issues as something to transition through is a flawed notion. Identity and life are always in flux, willpower is for chumps, and the only finish lines are the ones you impose upon yourself. Assessing the impact of technological skills on students’ performance: Critical digital literacy and overconfidence bias Marta Samokishyn, Saint Paul University Keywords: digital literacy; overconfidence; digital technologies Abstract Integration of technology-based skills into digital pedagogy practices has been a focal point of higher education in recent years. However, what is the effect of overconfidence bias on critical digital literacy skills? Through the literature findings and our 2-year quantitative study results, this poster will establish the foundations for the evidence-based approach for the teaching of critical digital literacy in the libraries, and determine what roles librarians can play in delivering the critical literacy pedagogy in the classrooms.

Green Room Discussions Chair/Host Housekeeping notes to be discussed in the 15-minute green room time period before the event: To alert presenters that they are nearing the end of their presentation time, you will be turning on your video at the 3-minute mark. During Q &amp; A, it might be helpful to prepare a couple of questions to kick-start the Q &amp; A. When you are not speaking, turn off your video and ensure that your microphone is muted. If the presenter is going overtime, the chair (you) may (at your discretion) audibly intervene to inform the presenter that they must conclude. Staying on time is imperative to a successful virtual session! Prepare some speaking notes in the event that you need to jump in and chat with the audience unexpectedly due to technical and/or loss of presenter. Promote the next session that will follow. Check the OTESSA Program page for details. Be ready to monitor the timing of your session based on the amount of time of the session, the number of speakers and leave 15 minutes for Q&amp;A and the last 3 minutes for a thank you and promotion of the next event. Code of Conduct Concerns The host/chair can also reach out to the Event Technician privately via chat about anything that they feel uncomfortable about or wish to take action on within the session. Congress Ombuds can be reached directly at congressh.ombuds@gmail.com. Important: The event tech will confirm with the chair/host that they (chair/host) will be the lead for decisions arising from a code of conduct concern. The event tech will be prepared to react, with direction from the chair/host, to do the following within the first 2 to 3 minutes: Mute the attendee presenting inappropriate discourse Turn off the video of the attendee Disengage chat and/or Q&amp;A feature Remove attendee from the session and put them into the waiting room Submit via chat feature to the waiting room the following text: &gt; Under the guidelines of our Code of Conduct, we are committed to offering a safe space for all attendees. The conduct demonstrated did not support maintaining a safe space and therefore the decision was made to remove you from the session. You may reach out to the Congress Ombuds to discuss your concerns. Confidential email: Congressh.ombuds@gmail.com. Note: the number of steps taken above will be determined by the chair/host. The chair/host does not need to expand on the situation that just occurred, but indicate that it is our intent to maintain a safe environment for all attendees. If any attendee feels they wish to discuss this matter after the session, the Congress Ombuds Team can be reached at the confidential email address of congressh.ombuds@gmail.com. The event tech will add the email address to the chat shortly. Note: If the event tech is not able to engage with the chair/host through chat after the 2-minute time period, the event tech will contact the Federation Duty Manager to assist and possibly make the decision. The Federation does not wish to intervene, and would prefer to have the association make the decision about their own attendees, however, the safety of all attendees is our top priority. Contingencies In the event that a presenter does not show up and the host has made a consistent effort to get in touch with them we will simply continue onto the next presenter. As all presenters should be online 15 minutes prior, if a presenter has not arrived in time for their actual presentation start time, we will not be able to wait for them…the show must go on! Should folks be having serious internet issues we will recommend they either give their talk without a slide deck or stay off video or a combination of these things. If the chair is having connectivity issues, we will ask them to remain off video as well. Should we need to exit a session and re-open a new one we will adjust the link in the virtual platform as quickly as possible.
